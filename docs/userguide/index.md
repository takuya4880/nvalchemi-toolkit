# User Guide

Welcome to the ALCHEMI Toolkit user guide: this side of the documentation
is to provide a high-level and conceptual understanding of the philosophy
and supported features in `nvalchemi`.

## Quick Start

The quickest way to install ALCHEMI Toolkit, without specifying optional
dependencies or CUDA version:

```bash
$ pip install nvalchemi-toolkit
```

Make sure it is importable:

```bash
$ python -c "import nvalchemi; print(nvalchemi.__version__)"
```

For install options, refer to the install guide below.
