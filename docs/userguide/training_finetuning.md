# Training & Fine-tuning

ALCHEMI Toolkit groups model training, loss composition, and pretrained-model
adaptation into one workflow family. Start with the training lifecycle, then use
the losses and fine-tuning guides when you need more control over objectives or
checkpoint adaptation, and the distillation guide when the supervision comes
from another model rather than from reference labels. The distillation recipes
guide covers the JSON recipe and the `distill` CLI that run a distillation end
to end.
