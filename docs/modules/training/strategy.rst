Strategies

.. dataclass-table:: nvalchemi.training.TrainingStrategy

``devices`` has length ``1`` or ``len(models)``. A named-model run stages one
batch on ``devices[0]`` and hands it to every model, so a per-model list has to
name the same device throughout and one naming more than one distinct device is
refused at run time; the longer form is a spelling that lets a caller enumerate
the models it places, not a way to span devices. Names are compared as written,
which keeps an index-less ``cuda`` — whichever device the process has made
current — apart from ``cuda:0``. A single-model run is unaffected, and a
:class:`~nvalchemi.training.hooks.DDPHook` on the NCCL backend collapses
``devices`` to this rank's own device before the check runs.

Parallelism helpers
-------------------

A parallelism wrapper stands in for the model a strategy holds, so anything
reaching for the model's own surface — its ``model_config``, a
:class:`~nvalchemi.models.base.BaseModelMixin` method, an unwrapped
``state_dict`` — has to step through it first. :func:`unwrap_model` returns the
module behind the wrapper, or the model itself when nothing wraps it, and
recognizes a wrapper by the ``module`` attribute it publishes rather than by its
class, so a hand-rolled wrapper unwraps exactly as
:class:`~torch.nn.parallel.DistributedDataParallel` does.
