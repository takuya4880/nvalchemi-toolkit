Losses — Training Terms
=======================

Composable, tensor-first loss functions for MLIP training.

.. seealso::

   - **User guide**: :ref:`losses_guide` — conceptual overview, usage
     patterns, and how to write your own loss term.

A typical training loss is a composition of tensor-first leaf losses. The
composition routes prediction/target mappings into each leaf, applies the
configured weights, and returns a structured output whose ``total_loss`` is the
scalar used for backpropagation:

.. code-block:: python

   from nvalchemi.training import ComposedLossFunction, EnergyMSELoss, ForceMSELoss

   loss_fn = ComposedLossFunction(
       components=[
           EnergyMSELoss(),
           ForceMSELoss(),
       ],
       weights=[1.0, 10.0],
   )

   out = loss_fn(predictions, targets, batch=batch, step=step, epoch=epoch)
   out["total_loss"].backward()

   for name, value in out["per_component_unweighted"].items():
       logger.info("%s raw loss: %s", name, value.detach())



Dtype alignment
---------------

Leaf losses default to ``dtype_policy="strict"``, which preserves prediction
and target tensors and raises on dtype mismatch during validation. Built-in
leaves also accept ``"prediction_to_target"`` and ``"target_to_prediction"`` to
cast one tensor before validation. ``ComposedLossFunction(dtype_policy=...)``
provides the same policy as a call-time default for strict leaves without
mutating reusable component instances. For compositions built with operator
sugar, set ``loss_fn.dtype_policy`` after construction.

Leaf and composition
--------------------

Leaf losses subclass :class:`~nvalchemi.training.BaseLossFunction`;
compositions use :class:`~nvalchemi.training.ComposedLossFunction` and
return a :class:`~nvalchemi.training.ComposedLossOutput`.

Concrete losses

   StressHuberLoss


Weight schedules
----------------

Pydantic ``frozen`` models satisfying :class:`~nvalchemi.training.LossWeightSchedule`.
Custom schedules may also satisfy the protocol directly. For strategy checkpoint
round-trips, implement ``to_spec()`` returning a ``BaseSpec``. The built-in
Pydantic schedule base provides this method from ``model_dump()``.

Reduction helpers
-----------------

Per-graph reduction helpers — scatter reductions (``V ... → B ...``),
the graph-balanced and masked scalars built on them (``V ... → ()``), and
matrix reductions (``B ... m n → B ...``) — importable for use in custom
losses.
