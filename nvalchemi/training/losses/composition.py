"""Composable :class:`torch.nn.Module`-based loss-function abstractions.

Leaf loss terms are tensor-to-tensor :class:`BaseLossFunction` instances
whose :meth:`~BaseLossFunction.forward` returns the raw, unweighted loss
tensor. :class:`ComposedLossFunction` owns the per-component weighting
(either floats or :class:`LossWeightSchedule` instances) and, by default,
normalizes the resolved weights so they sum to ``1.0`` at every call.
This keeps weight scheduling a *relative* knob and leaves the learning
rate as the sole *absolute* magnitude control.

    Checks dtype equality first (a dtype mismatch is usually a bug
    upstream of shape), then the shape compatibility policy selected by
    ``strict``.

    Shape policy
    ------------
    ``strict=False`` (default) accepts any pair of shapes that is
    broadcast-compatible via :func:`torch.broadcast_shapes`. This is
    convenient for custom losses that legitimately broadcast (e.g. a
    per-graph scale against a per-component target) but is a trap for
    elementwise losses: ``(B, 1)`` vs ``(B, 3)`` passes, and the
    subsequent ``pred - target`` silently broadcasts into a ``(B, 3)``
    residual — usually not what you intend.

    ``strict=True`` requires ``pred.shape == target.shape`` exactly. All
    built-in leaf losses (:class:`EnergyMSELoss`, :class:`ForceMSELoss`,
    :class:`StressMSELoss`) pass ``strict=True`` because their elementwise
    arithmetic would otherwise corrupt the scalar loss under a
    broadcast-compatible-but-unequal pair. Custom
    :class:`BaseLossFunction` subclasses that do elementwise arithmetic
    should also pass ``strict=True``.

    Parameters
    ----------
    pred : torch.Tensor
        Prediction tensor.
    target : torch.Tensor
        Target tensor whose dtype must equal ``pred``'s and whose shape
        must be compatible with ``pred``'s under the selected policy.
    name : str
        Calling loss-term's class name, used as a prefix in the error
        message (typically ``type(self).__name__``).
    prediction_key : str, optional
        Key the prediction tensor was pulled from in the composed
        mapping. When provided, included in the error message.
    target_key : str, optional
        Key the target tensor was pulled from in the composed mapping.

    strict : bool, default False

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If ``pred.dtype != target.dtype``, or if the shape policy is
        violated (broadcast-incompatible for ``strict=False``, unequal

class BaseLossFunction(nn.Module, abc.ABC):
    """Abstract :class:`torch.nn.Module` base for ALCHEMI loss functions.

    ``BaseLossFunction`` implements a **template-method**
    :meth:`forward` pipeline that orchestrates five overridable hooks:

    1. :meth:`validate` — shape / dtype checks.
    2. :meth:`normalize` — pre-process ``pred`` and ``target``
       (e.g. per-atom energy division) and return a
       :class:`ReductionContext` for downstream hooks.
    3. :meth:`mask` — produce a boolean validity tensor
       (e.g. ``torch.isfinite``, padding masks).
    4. :meth:`compute_residual` — **abstract**; the only method every
       leaf *must* implement. Receives ``pred``, ``target``, and the
       validity ``mask`` produced by step 3.
    5. :meth:`reduce` — collapse the residual tensor and validity mask
       into a scalar loss and populate :attr:`per_sample_loss`.

    Loss authors subclass ``BaseLossFunction`` and override
    :meth:`compute_residual` at a minimum. Normalization, masking, and
    reduction come free via the defaults, or can be overridden
    individually for domain-specific behaviour (e.g. per-atom energy
    division in :meth:`normalize`, padding-aware force masking in
    :meth:`mask`, graph-balanced force reduction in :meth:`reduce`).

    Leaves are weightless — weighting and scheduling live on
    :class:`ComposedLossFunction`. Operator sugar
    (``scalar * leaf``, ``leaf + leaf``, ``sum([...])``) produces a
    composition; see :class:`ComposedLossFunction` for semantics.

    Attributes
    ----------
    requires_eval_grad : bool | None
        Whether this loss term requires autograd during evaluation. Losses
        based on derived outputs such as forces and stress should set this to
        ``True``; direct scalar-output losses should set it to ``False``.
        ``None`` means callers cannot infer the policy automatically.
    dtype_policy : {"strict", "prediction_to_target", "target_to_prediction"}
        How ``forward`` handles prediction/target dtype mismatches before
        validation. ``strict`` preserves both tensors and raises on mismatch.
        The other policies cast one tensor to the other's dtype before the
        leaf validates shapes and dtypes.
    per_sample_loss : torch.Tensor | None
        Detached per-graph loss tensor of shape ``(B,)`` left as a side
        effect of the most recent :meth:`forward` call, or ``None`` when
        the loss does not naturally compute a per-graph view (or when
        ``forward`` has never been called). Intended for logging and
        diagnostics only — gradients flow through the scalar returned by
        :meth:`forward`, not through this attribute.

class ComposedLossFunction(nn.Module):
    """Weighted sum of :class:`BaseLossFunction` components.

    This class owns the per-component weighting — leaves are weightless.
    Weights may be plain floats or :class:`LossWeightSchedule` instances;
    they are resolved to floats at call time. By default the resolved
    weights are normalized to sum to ``1.0`` so scheduling controls
    *relative* contributions while the learning rate controls the
    absolute loss magnitude. Opt out with ``normalize_weights=False``.

    Components live in an :class:`torch.nn.ModuleList` for
    ``.modules()`` / ``.state_dict()`` / nested-``__repr__`` support.
    When a component is itself a :class:`ComposedLossFunction`, its
    components and weights are flattened into the parent element-wise so
    ``(A + B) + C`` is equivalent to ``A + B + C``.

    Parameters
    ----------
    components
        Loss terms to combine; must contain at least one element.
    weights
        Optional per-component weights. When provided, ``weights`` must
        have the same length as ``components`` at construction time
        (i.e. top-level components — child weights inside nested
        compositions are multiplied element-wise by the parent weight
        during flattening). A ``None`` entry is shorthand for ``1.0``,
        so ``weights=[None, 2.0, None]`` means "component 1 gets 2x,
        others default". Passing ``weights=None`` defaults every
        component to ``1.0``.
    normalize_weights
        When ``True`` (default), resolved weights are divided by their
        sum at each call so the effective weights sum to ``1.0``. A
        zero-sum raises :class:`ValueError`. When ``False``, raw
        weighted sums are returned.
    dtype_policy
        Optional composed-level dtype policy applied at call time for
        components whose own ``dtype_policy`` is still ``"strict"``. This
        avoids mutating reusable leaf instances while allowing one composed
        loss to opt into automatic dtype alignment.

    Attributes
    ----------
    components
        :class:`torch.nn.ModuleList` of the flattened leaf components.
    normalize_weights
        Whether effective weights are renormalized to sum to ``1.0``.
    dtype_policy
        Composed-level dtype alignment policy, or ``None`` when each leaf
        controls dtype handling independently.
