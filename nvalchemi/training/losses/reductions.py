r"""Graph-aware reduction primitives for loss functions.

Scatter reductions (``V ... → B ...``)
--------------------------------------

:func:`per_graph_sum` and :func:`per_graph_mean` take a flat per-node
tensor with a ``batch_idx`` mapping each node to its graph and reduce
the leading node dim into a per-graph output, preserving trailing dims
verbatim. Both accumulate in at least fp32 and return that width, so a
half-precision input reduces to an fp32 per-graph tensor.

These helpers only produce per-graph tensors. They do not choose the
final scalar weighting across graphs. For per-graph values :math:`x_i`,
a graph-balanced scalar is :math:`B^{-1} \sum_i x_i`, while an
atom-weighted scalar is :math:`(\sum_i N_i x_i) / (\sum_i N_i)`.

Graph-balanced scalar (``V ... → ()``)
--------------------------------------

:func:`graph_balanced_mean` composes the scatter reduction with the
graph-balanced weighting: it sums a per-node residual and its validity
weights per graph, divides, and averages the per-graph means. Loss
terms that mean over graphs rather than over atoms share it instead of
re-deriving the per-graph numerator and denominator.

Masked scalar (``V ... → ()``)
------------------------------

:func:`masked_mean` is the reduction a per-node loss term with a
``normalize_by_atom_count`` switch ends in: the global mean of a masked
residual over its valid entries, or :func:`graph_balanced_mean` when the
switch is on, reading ``batch_idx`` and ``num_graphs`` from a batch when
they are not passed. Both branches accumulate in at least fp32.

Matrix reductions (``B ... m n → B ...``)
-----------------------------------------

:func:`frobenius_mse` is *not* a scatter reduction: it operates on an
already-per-graph tensor and averages the squared residual over the
trailing two matrix dims. It takes neither ``batch_idx`` nor
``num_graphs``.

Common parameters for scatter reductions
----------------------------------------

- ``values``: per-node tensor whose leading dim indexes nodes; trailing
  dims are preserved.
- ``batch_idx``: 1-D ``BatchIndices`` mapping each node to its graph.
- ``num_graphs`` (optional): when supplied, trusted without scanning
  ``batch_idx`` — the recommended hot-path convention (avoids a GPU→CPU
  sync). When omitted, inferred as ``batch_idx.max().item() + 1``.
  Empty ``batch_idx`` always requires ``num_graphs``.

Scatter reductions raise :class:`ValueError` on shape mismatch, on
non-positive ``num_graphs``, or on inability to infer ``num_graphs``.

Migrating from ``per_graph_mse``
--------------------------------

The former ``per_graph_mse`` helper has been removed. The direct
replacement composes :func:`per_graph_mean` with a pointwise squared
error::

    per_graph_mean((pred - target).pow(2), batch_idx, num_graphs)

Hot-path callers that want a scalar-per-graph MSE should reduce
trailing dims before scattering::

    per_graph_mean(
        (pred - target).pow(2).mean(dim=tuple(range(1, pred.ndim))),
        batch_idx,
        num_graphs,
