"""Loss-function abstractions, schedules, terms, and reductions.

Loss terms are :class:`BaseLossFunction` instances that consume
prediction and target tensors directly and return raw (unweighted) loss
tensors. :class:`ComposedLossFunction` owns the per-component weighting
— either plain floats or :class:`LossWeightSchedule` instances — and,
by default, renormalizes the effective weights to sum to ``1.0``.
Operator sugar (``3.0 * EnergyMSELoss() + 2.0 * ForceMSELoss()``) builds a
composition in one expression. Schedule instances attached to a
composition's weights are reconstructed by ``TrainingStrategy`` from
their ``(instance, spec)`` pair, mirroring the pattern used for models
and optimizers.
