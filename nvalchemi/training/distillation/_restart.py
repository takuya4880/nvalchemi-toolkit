"""Restart state of an interrupted on-policy segment loop.

A strategy checkpoint carries weights, optimizer state, and counters. None of
them record where the propagator had got to. This module packs that missing
state into a *restart bundle*: the live trajectory batch, the propagator's
step count, the initial structures' position, the replay frames, and the
settings the run used. The trajectory and the replay frames are packed as flat
tensor mappings. A :class:`~nvalchemi.hooks.CheckpointableHook` carries the
bundle through the existing hook-state file, and this module unpacks it on the
way back in. A bundle is checked when it is packed, while the run that wrote it
can still be fixed and relaunched, so an inconsistency is raised there rather
than hours later at the restore.

    ----------
