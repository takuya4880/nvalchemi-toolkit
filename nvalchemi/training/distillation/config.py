    """Run one ``compute()`` on *probe* and check the result against the declared keys.

    :meth:`~nvalchemi.dynamics.base.BaseDynamics.check_initial_batch`
    compares the declared keys with the initial structures. This function
    compares them with what ``compute()`` actually does. A propagator whose
    declarations no longer match its implementation is therefore rejected
    here rather than on the first step of a long run. Examples are a
    ``__needs_keys__`` output the student does not produce, or a field that
    ``compute()`` reads but nothing declared. The cost is one student forward
    pass at construction, which front-loads the kernel and CUDA
    initialization the first step pays anyway.

    The forward pass runs with the same isolation the scorer uses. The model
    is held in evaluation mode, and every submodule's own ``training`` flag is
    restored afterwards. ``compute()`` restores the ``requires_grad`` flags it
    enables. The propagator's ``_last_outputs`` is put back. The probe batch
    is the caller's own row, moved to the model's device. A graph model gets
    the neighbor list its ``neighbor_config`` declares, built on the probe and
    rolled back afterwards; during a run, a hook builds the propagator's list
    instead. A model that plans more than one neighbor-list source is not
    probed, and a warning says so. The probe builds exactly one list, and the
    check must not reject a propagator the loop can run.

    Parameters
    ----------
    probe : Batch

    -------
    Batch | None

    inherits these settings and adds the live objects the loop drives. That
    class and the strategy check whether those objects work with the loop.

    Parameters
    ----------
    replay_ratio : float
        Fraction of every training batch drawn from the replay buffer. The
        reference dataset supplies the rest.
    training_steps_per_segment : int
        Optimizer steps taken per segment, one per training batch.
    batch_size : int, optional
        Samples per training batch, counting both sources of the mixture.
        Default ``8``.
    generation_steps : int, optional
        Propagator steps generated per segment. Default ``100``.
    label_frequency : int, optional
        Propagator steps between teacher labelings. Each segment's last frame
        is labeled in addition. Default ``100``.
    replay_capacity : int | None, optional
        Frame capacity of the replay buffer. Default ``None`` (unbounded).
    replay_eviction : {"fifo"}, optional
        Eviction policy of the replay buffer, as a name a recipe can store. A
        policy instance is passed to :class:`OnPolicyConfig` instead. Default
        ``"fifo"``.
    replay_device : str | None, optional
        Device the replay buffer keeps frames on. An index-less ``cuda`` names
        the device this rank has made current. Default ``None`` uses the
        device the reference dataset emits its batches on, or host memory when
        there is no reference dataset.
    seed : int, optional
        Base seed of every segment's mixture sampler. Default ``0``.
    rank_seed_stride : int, optional
        Seed-space distance between neighboring ranks on a multi-rank launch.
        Default ``1_000_003``.
    require_wrapped_student : bool, optional
        Whether a multi-rank run refuses to start unless the ``SETUP`` stage
        replaced the student with a wrapper owning it. Default ``True``.
    fmax : float | None, optional
        Max force norm below which a generated trajectory counts as finished.
        Setting it turns on the trajectory lifecycle of a relaxation run, in
        which converged structures leave the batch and fresh initial
        structures replace them. Default ``None`` ends no trajectory, which
        suits a molecular-dynamics run.
    weight_sync_frequency : int, optional
        Segments between weight syncs to the propagator. Default ``1``, the
        only accepted value while the propagator shares the student module.
    probe : bool, optional
        Whether :class:`OnPolicyConfig` runs the propagator's ``compute()`` on
        one initial structure at construction to check it against its
        declared keys. ``False`` defers any mismatch to the first step.
        Default ``True``.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If a count or the threshold is not positive, if ``replay_ratio`` falls
        outside ``[0, 1]`` or is exactly ``0``, if rounding the ratio against
        the batch size gives one mixture source no sample in any batch, or if
        ``weight_sync_frequency`` is not ``1``.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> from nvalchemi.training.distillation import OnPolicySettings
    >>> settings = OnPolicySettings(replay_ratio=0.25, training_steps_per_segment=32)
    >>> settings.batch_size
    8

    Notes
    -----
    ``label_frequency`` is the throughput setting. It counts against the
    propagator's cumulative ``step_count``, so the labeling cadence does not
    restart at a segment boundary. Each segment also labels the frame it ends
    on, and the cadence dispatch adjacent to that forced label is skipped.
    With ``generation_steps`` a multiple of ``label_frequency``, each
    trajectory is therefore labeled ``generation_steps // label_frequency``
    times per segment, which is once per segment only when the two are equal.
    The first segment pays one more, for the cadence dispatch at step ``0``.
    ``training_steps_per_segment`` counts training batches. It equals the
    number of optimizer steps only while every batch takes one step.
    ``fmax`` is compared against the student's forces, which are the forces
    the propagator follows. It therefore measures the convergence of the
    relaxation itself.

    Size ``replay_capacity`` as a multiple of the trajectory count. Otherwise
    FIFO eviction removes only part of one labeled step's frames, which
    over-represents the structures at the back of the batch. Space the
    ``seed`` of replicate runs by at least
    ``num_steps // training_steps_per_segment``, because the sampler adds the
    segment index to it. See :ref:`training-distillation-api`.

    On a multi-rank launch each rank moves ``seed``, and every integer seed
    ``dynamics`` and its sub-stages expose, onto its own stride of the seed
    space. Ranks therefore draw the reference dataset independently and apply
    different thermostat noise to the structures they were dealt. The stride
    is ``rank_seed_stride``, whose default clears the counter either stream
    adds. A replicate launch whose seeds would land on another rank's stride
    picks a different one. A stage
    holding a :class:`torch.Generator` and no integer seed is named in a
    warning and needs a rank-distinct seed from the caller. A multi-rank run
    also checks that the ``SETUP`` stage put a gradient-synchronizing wrapper
    in the student's place; ``require_wrapped_student=False`` waives that for
    a wrapper working in place, such as FSDP2's ``fully_shard`` or hook-based
    synchronization, and makes keeping the ranks' students in step the
    caller's responsibility.

class OnPolicyConfig(OnPolicySettings):
    """Settings and live objects of one on-policy distillation segment loop.

    Each *segment* has two phases. The *generation* phase runs the student's
    own propagator for ``generation_steps`` steps and labels frames with the
    teacher as it goes. The *training* phase then takes
    ``training_steps_per_segment`` optimizer steps. Its batches are a
    *mixture* of the reference dataset and the replay buffer, split at
    ``replay_ratio``. The propagator holds the module the trainer updates, so
    each segment generates from a fresher policy than the last. The scalar
    settings come from :class:`OnPolicySettings`, which this class inherits so
    that a recipe stays flat. :attr:`settings` returns a detached copy of them
    for a pre-flight check or a restart bundle.

    The propagator can be any :class:`~nvalchemi.dynamics.base.BaseDynamics`.
    A relaxation optimizer such as :class:`~nvalchemi.dynamics.optimizers.FIRE`
    drives the loop exactly as a thermostat does. The initial structures must
    carry every field the propagator updates in place through
    ``__provides_keys__``. For every shipped propagator these include
    ``velocities``, and the variable-cell ones also need a ``cell``. The model
    outputs named by ``__needs_keys__`` are computed before the first step, so
    they need not be present. Construction checks one row, so a missing field
    is a construction error rather than a failure on the first step. The
    propagator's ``compute()`` then runs once on that row. This rejects
    declarations that no longer match the implementation, such as a
    ``__needs_keys__`` output the student never produces or a field
    ``compute()`` reads that nothing declared. The cost is one student forward
    pass at construction. A graph model is probed with the neighbor list its
    ``neighbor_config`` declares, built on the row and rolled back afterwards.
    A model that plans more than one neighbor-list source is not probed.

    A relaxation propagator needs a *trajectory lifecycle*. Relaxations
    converge, and a converged structure that keeps being propagated fills the
    replay buffer with near-duplicates of a frame it already holds. ``fmax``
    turns the lifecycle on. A converged structure freezes and is stored once,
    as the minimum it reached. At the segment boundary it *graduates*, that
    is, it leaves the batch, and the initial structures *backfill* a fresh
    structure in its place for as long as the source holds rows. An
    :class:`~nvalchemi.training.distillation.InitialStructures` built with
    ``recycle=True`` wraps to its first row instead of letting the batch
    narrow. Generation ends when the last trajectory finishes, and the
    remaining training steps draw on the frames already in the buffer.

    Parameters
    ----------
    dynamics : BaseDynamics
        Propagator that generates on-policy frames. It holds the student
        module.
    teacher_scorer : TeacherScorer
        Scorer that labels generated frames. A custom scorer that declares
        ``label_fields`` lets the fields it writes be known before the run.
    initial_structures : InitialStructuresSource
        Structures the generated trajectories start from, served from a
        position that a backfill and a restart share, and dealt out strided
        across the ranks of a multi-rank launch. Pass an
        :class:`~nvalchemi.training.distillation.InitialStructures`, any other
        object that implements the protocol, or a bare dataset, which is
        wrapped in an ``InitialStructures``.
    capture_sink : DataSink | None, optional
        Sink that stages each segment's labeled frames until the segment
        boundary drains them into the replay buffer. A
        :class:`~nvalchemi.dynamics.sinks.GPUBuffer` keeps the staged frames on
        the generation device and avoids a device-to-host copy per frame.
        Default ``None`` builds a host-memory sink per segment.
    replay_eviction : {"fifo"} | EvictionPolicy, optional
        Eviction policy of the replay buffer: the name ``"fifo"`` or a live
        :class:`~nvalchemi.training.distillation.EvictionPolicy` instance.
        Default ``"fifo"``.
    replay_admission : AdmissionPolicy | None, optional
        Predicate that selects which captured frames each segment admits into
        the replay buffer. Default ``None`` admits every captured frame.
    convergence_hook : ConvergenceHook | None, optional
        Live criterion that decides when a generated trajectory is finished,
        used instead of the ``fmax`` threshold. Default ``None``.
    divergence : Callable[[Batch], Bool[torch.Tensor, "G"]] | None, optional
        Predicate over the live frame that returns one boolean per graph,
        ``True`` where the trajectory diverged. The lifecycle freezes a flagged
        graph on the step it is flagged and keeps it out of both capture
        routes. At the segment boundary it retires the graph and backfills its
        place. Default ``None`` uses
        :func:`~nvalchemi.training.distillation.nonfinite_divergence`.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If a setting is out of range, if both ``fmax`` and
        ``convergence_hook`` are set, if ``convergence_hook`` cannot manage
        the lifecycle, if ``initial_structures`` recycles while no criterion is
        set, if a criterion is paired with a
        :class:`~nvalchemi.distributed.DomainParallel` propagator or a
        multi-sub-stage :class:`~nvalchemi.dynamics.FusedStage`, if
        ``initial_structures`` is neither a source nor a dataset, if the
        initial structures lack a field the propagator needs for its first
        step, or if the propagator's ``compute()`` on one row contradicts its
        declared keys.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> from nvalchemi.training.distillation import (  # doctest: +SKIP
    ...     InProcessTeacherScorer,
    ...     OnPolicyConfig,
    ...     InitialStructures,
    ... )
    >>> config = OnPolicyConfig(  # doctest: +SKIP
    ...     dynamics=NVTLangevin(student, dt=0.5, temperature=300.0),
    ...     teacher_scorer=InProcessTeacherScorer(teacher, ["energy", "forces"]),
    ...     initial_structures=InitialStructures(dataset),
    ...     replay_ratio=0.25,
    ...     training_steps_per_segment=32,
    ...     batch_size=16,
    ...     generation_steps=50,
    ...     label_frequency=10,
    ...     replay_capacity=8192,
    ... )

    The same loop over relaxation paths. Each structure graduates once its max
    force norm falls below ``0.05``, and the next initial structure takes its
    place:

    >>> config = OnPolicyConfig(  # doctest: +SKIP
    ...     dynamics=FIRE(student, dt=0.1),
    ...     teacher_scorer=InProcessTeacherScorer(teacher, ["energy", "forces"]),
    ...     initial_structures=InitialStructures(dataset, recycle=True),
    ...     fmax=0.05,
    ...     replay_ratio=0.25,
    ...     training_steps_per_segment=32,
    ...     batch_size=16,
    ...     generation_steps=50,
    ...     label_frequency=10,
    ... )

    Notes
    -----
    Any :class:`~nvalchemi.training.distillation.TeacherScorer` may drive
    generation. A custom scorer can declare ``label_fields``. The declaration
    lets :class:`~nvalchemi.training.distillation.DistillationStrategy` check
    the generated fields against ``reference_dataset`` at construction. It
    also keeps :class:`~nvalchemi.training.distillation.TeacherLabelHook` from
    re-scoring a frame that is dispatched again. A custom ``teacher_*`` field
    the scorer writes is an ordinary loss target, so the reference dataset and
    any validation data must carry it too.

    The loop sizes ``capture_sink``. A segment captures at most one frame per
    trajectory per labeled step, including the forced last frame. The sink
    must therefore hold ``(generation_steps + 1)`` frames per trajectory in
    the propagated batch. A configured sink with less capacity is grown
    through ``resize(capacity)`` when it satisfies
    :class:`~nvalchemi.dynamics.ResizableSink`, and rejected otherwise. The
    sink must also be empty when a segment starts, because everything it holds
    is drained into the replay buffer as generated frames.

    ``capture_sink`` is runtime-only, like ``dynamics`` and
    ``teacher_scorer``, so no recipe names it. A recipe does not name a policy
    instance either. :attr:`settings` records a custom ``replay_eviction`` as
    ``"fifo"`` with a warning, and a config rebuilt from those settings evicts
    FIFO until the policy is supplied again.

    ``fmax`` stays a plain number that a recipe can hold.
    :attr:`convergence_criterion` is the live criterion the lifecycle drives.
    For an ``fmax`` threshold, it is built once with
    :meth:`~nvalchemi.dynamics.base.ConvergenceHook.from_fmax`, migrating
    status ``0`` to the propagator's ``exit_status``. The same object is
    returned on every read, because the lifecycle registers that one object
    and removes it by identity. A criterion that has to be a live hook goes to
    ``convergence_hook`` instead. Setting both ``fmax`` and
    ``convergence_hook`` is refused.

    A ``convergence_hook`` must migrate status on every step, from the status
    ``0`` the run stamps its structures with. A hook that only reports
    convergence would freeze and graduate nothing. A hook that skips steps
    graduates a structure late, so both capture routes would store it. The
    construction probe also dispatches a copy of the criterion to the probed
    row. A criterion that raises on the propagator's outputs, or whose firing
    leaves ``status`` unchanged, is therefore refused here. A criterion that
    reads a key no ``compute()`` produces is not dispatched, because a hook
    may write that key during the step; a warning names the key instead.
    ``probe=False`` skips this dispatch along with the forward pass it reads.

    ``divergence`` ends a trajectory before it converges. It has the same
    shape as :class:`~nvalchemi.training.distillation.AdmissionPolicy`: it
    takes the live frame and returns one boolean per graph. The default flags
    a graph whose positions or forces are no longer finite. Use a custom
    predicate for a student whose forces explode to finite but unphysical
    values, or for a criterion on the energy. Like ``replay_admission``, the
    predicate is runtime-only. A predicate that returns anything but one
    boolean per graph is refused on its first dispatch, and the error names
    the shape it returned.

    For the duration of the loop, the criterion also becomes the propagator's
    convergence detector. It must be the only hook that migrates status, so a
    propagator that carries a second migrating
    :class:`~nvalchemi.dynamics.base.ConvergenceHook` is refused. A
    :class:`~nvalchemi.dynamics.FusedStage` builds such a hook for every
    sub-stage except the last, and for the last one whenever it declares a
    ``convergence_hook``. Only a single-sub-stage fused stage without a
    criterion of its own is therefore accepted. A
    :class:`~nvalchemi.distributed.DomainParallel` propagator is refused with
    a criterion as well: its step dispatches no ``ON_GRADUATE``, the stage
    the converged route captures at, so its minima would never be stored. A
    migrator already on the propagator is refused when the config is built,
    and one registered afterwards is refused when the run starts. See
    :ref:`training-distillation-api` for the capture routes and the backfill.
