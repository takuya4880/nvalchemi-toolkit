    :class:`~nvalchemi.training.distillation.EmbeddingMatchingLoss` needs this
    training function. The batch is left as it was found. When the strategy
    has a ``"projector"`` model, the projector is applied to the student's
    embeddings before they are returned, never to the teacher's, and it trains
    through its own ``optimizer_configs`` entry.

    Parameters
    ----------
    models : Mapping[str, BaseModelMixin]
        Named models of the strategy; ``"student"`` and, when present,
        ``"projector"`` are read.
    batch : Batch

    Raises
    ------
    RuntimeError
        If the student's ``compute_embeddings`` writes no ``node_embeddings``.
        Also if, while gradients are enabled and at least one student parameter
        is trainable, it writes embeddings detached from those parameters, as a
        wrapper that computes them under :func:`torch.no_grad` does; the
        embedding term could not train the student through them. A student
        with no trainable parameter skips this second check, since there is
        nothing for the embeddings to be detached from. A projector that
        declares ``frozen_student=True`` waives it too, for a student whose
        representation is frozen on purpose so that the projector alone
        carries the term.

    Notes
    -----
    The student runs twice per batch, which doubles its share of a training
    step. ``compute_embeddings`` is not part of the interface a
    :class:`~torch.nn.parallel.DistributedDataParallel` replica proxies, so the
    embedding pass runs on the wrapped module. Its gradients are still
    reduced. However, ``find_unused_parameters=True`` cannot see a student
    submodule exercised *only* by ``compute_embeddings``; that combination is
    the one configuration to avoid.

    narrowed to the student's energy. The second pass is needed because a

    the stock forward's energy cannot be differentiated again. Both

    Notes
    -----
    On every frame the student trains on, the second pass adds two backward
    passes, one of them through a second-order graph held for the whole step.
    A stochastic student draws afresh in the narrowed pass, so its curvature is
    measured on a different realization than its energy.

    """Install the convergence machinery of a relaxation run on the propagator.

    The config's :attr:`~OnPolicyConfig.convergence_criterion` is installed on
    the propagator in two roles. As a registered ``AFTER_STEP`` hook, it
    migrates the status of converged graphs, which freezes them. The
    propagator reports that migration at ``ON_GRADUATE``, where the capture
    hook stores the frame, and the segment boundary reads the migrated
    status. As the propagator's ``convergence_hook``, it is the detector that
    ends a chunk early once every graph has converged. A detector the
    propagator was built with is restored on exit.

    The criterion must be the only status migrator. A looser migrator would
    graduate a structure before this criterion accepts it, and neither capture
    route would store it. The config rejects such a migrator at construction,
    and the check runs again here for a hook registered since then. The
    lifecycle must also be the only source of refills, because a mid-segment
    refill compacts the surviving graphs and invalidates the divergence hook's
    per-graph record.

    A graph diverges when the config's :attr:`~OnPolicyConfig.divergence`
    predicate flags it; by default, when its state is no longer finite. A
    divergence hook registered after the criterion calls the predicate once
    per step, freezes each flagged graph at ``exit_status`` without capturing
    it, and records the verdict. The capture hook and the segment boundary
    read that record and never call the predicate themselves. The segment
    boundary then retires a diverged graph like a converged one.

    ----------
    config : OnPolicyConfig
        Segment-loop configuration, holding the criterion.

class DistillationStrategy(TrainingStrategy):
    """Train a student against a frozen teacher's signals.

    A :class:`~nvalchemi.training.TrainingStrategy` over the named models
    ``"student"`` and ``"teacher"``. The teacher is frozen by omission — it must
    not appear in ``optimizer_configs`` — while the student and any auxiliary
    model must be configured with one. Teacher knowledge reaches the loss as
    ``teacher_*`` batch fields, so a built-in term distills by pointing its
    ``target_key`` at one (``EnergyMSELoss(target_key="teacher_energy")``) and
    :class:`~nvalchemi.training.distillation.AtomicEnergyMatchingLoss` reads
    ``teacher_atomic_energies``; mixing teacher and reference targets is
    ordinary loss composition.

    The signals the teacher is asked for are derived from the ``teacher_*``
    targets the training loss and a ``validation_config`` loss read, or named
    in ``teacher_signals``, which must cover the derived set. They are checked
    against the teacher's outputs at construction, as are both losses'
    prediction keys against the outputs the student actually computes whenever
    the effective training or validation function is the stock
    :func:`default_distillation_fn`. Nothing re-runs on assignment, so pass
    ``validation_config`` to the constructor or, when rebuilding from a spec
    that excludes it, to :meth:`from_spec_dict`. Every resolved signal is required
    on every batch: a batch missing any resolved field is labeled on the fly by
    an internal ``BEFORE_FORWARD`` hook, in training and validation alike,
    unless ``label_missing=False`` leaves it to surface as a missing loss
    target, while a store written by
    :func:`~nvalchemi.training.distillation.label_dataset` with the same signal
    set trains with no teacher pass at all. A ``teacher_*`` target no built-in
    signal populates is a custom field such a store carries: it is neither
    derived nor attached, and a batch lacking it fails as a missing target.
    See :ref:`training-distillation-api` for the full contract.

    Setting ``on_policy`` switches :meth:`run` to the on-policy segment loop
    instead. In each segment, the student's own propagator generates frames
    and the teacher labels them. The labeled frames accumulate in a replay
    buffer. The segment then trains on a mixture of that buffer and
    ``reference_dataset`` at the configured ``replay_ratio``. The propagator
    holds the very module the optimizer updates, so every segment generates
    from a fresher policy than the last. That is what makes the data
    on-policy, and it is why the propagator's model is checked for object
    identity with ``models["student"]`` at construction. For a relaxation
    propagator, set ``OnPolicyConfig.fmax``. Converged structures are then
    stored once, graduate out of the batch at the segment boundary, and are
    replaced by fresh initial structures. The buffer therefore keeps filling
    with structures that are still moving.

    Beyond the signals that have a supervised shape, three objectives need more
    from the run than a target field. Embedding matching compares the
    student's and teacher's per-atom representations. It needs a second pass
    over the batch on both sides. Across architectures, it also needs the
    learnable :class:`~nvalchemi.training.distillation.EmbeddingProjector`,
    registered as a ``"projector"`` model with an optimizer of its own.
    Hessian matching compares Hessian-vector products, the products of each
    model's energy Hessian with a random probe direction. It needs the
    student's energy differentiated twice along the probe the teacher was
    labeled with. Neither of these predictions is a forward-pass output, so
    each objective needs the training function that produces it:
    :func:`~nvalchemi.training.distillation.embedding_distillation_fn` or
    :func:`~nvalchemi.training.distillation.hessian_distillation_fn`.
    Boltzmann matching compares the two models' Boltzmann distributions over
    configurations. It needs no new prediction, but it does need the on-policy
    loop, because it reads a batch as a sample of the student's own ensemble.
    All three requirements are checked at construction.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If ``models`` is not a named mapping containing ``"student"`` and
        ``"teacher"``, if the teacher is given an optimizer config, if the
        student or an auxiliary model is not, if a loss component reads a
        prediction the student does not compute or names one outside the
        ``predicted_`` namespace under a stock ``training_fn``, if an explicit
        ``teacher_signals`` omits a signal a loss needs, if no built-in teacher
        signal is requested at all, if the teacher cannot produce a requested signal,
        if the teacher is a composition that plans more than one neighbor-list
        source, or if ``label_dtype`` is not a floating-point dtype. With an
        embedding objective under the stock embedding training function, also
        if the student publishes no node-embedding shape, if the student,
        projector, and teacher widths do not compose, or if the projector
        declares ``frozen_student=True`` over a fully trainable student. With a
        Hessian objective, also if the student computes no energy. With a
        Boltzmann objective, also if the run is not on-policy, if
        ``on_policy.samples_equilibrium`` is ``False``, if it is left ``None``
        and the propagator relaxes or converges graphs out, if the term sits in
        the validation loss, or if a ``validation_config`` has no ``loss_fn`` of
        its own and would reuse the training loss. In on-policy mode, also if
        the run is sized in epochs, if the propagator holds neither the student
        nor a model composing it, if ``replay_ratio`` and ``reference_dataset``
        disagree (a ratio below ``1`` requires a reference dataset and a ratio
        of ``1`` rejects one), if ``reference_dataset`` is empty or emits on an
        accelerator the run does not train on, if ``replay_device`` or the
        reference dataset's fields cannot be mixed with generated frames, or if
        the propagator's scorer and the reference dataset do not carry the same
        teacher fields.

    Examples
    --------
    Distill energies, forces, and the teacher's per-atom energy decomposition
    from a store written by :func:`label_dataset`:

    >>> import torch
    >>> from nvalchemi.training import EnergyMSELoss, ForceMSELoss, OptimizerConfig
    >>> from nvalchemi.training.distillation import (
    ...     DistillationStrategy,
    ...     AtomicEnergyMatchingLoss,
    ... )
    >>> loss_fn = (
    ...     EnergyMSELoss(target_key="teacher_energy")
    ...     + ForceMSELoss(target_key="teacher_forces", normalize_by_atom_count=True)
    ...     + 0.1 * AtomicEnergyMatchingLoss()
    ... )
    >>> strategy = DistillationStrategy(  # doctest: +SKIP
    ...     models={"student": student, "teacher": teacher},
    ...     optimizer_configs={
    ...         "student": [OptimizerConfig(optimizer_cls=torch.optim.Adam)]
    ...     },
    ...     loss_fn=loss_fn,
    ...     num_steps=1_000,
    ... )
    >>> strategy.run(labeled_loader)  # doctest: +SKIP

    Notes
    -----
    Label precision is the scorer's decision. The strategy's own scorer is an
    :class:`~nvalchemi.training.distillation.InProcessTeacherScorer`, which
    disables autocast. It casts labels to ``label_dtype`` when one is given.
    By default the label dtype is inferred as the student's first
    floating-point parameter dtype, never below single precision, so a
    ``bfloat16`` or ``float16`` student gets float32 labels and needs
    ``dtype_policy="prediction_to_target"`` on its loss terms; a float64 student
    reads float32 back from a store and needs a ``dtype_policy`` too. Set
    ``label_dtype`` explicitly when the inference guesses wrong, as for a
    mixed-precision student whose first parameter is not representative or a
    student exposing no parameters at all, which otherwise keeps the teacher's
    own dtype. Labels are attached to the device-placed copy the strategy trains
    on, not the caller's batch, so a loader replaying the same systems costs one
    teacher pass per epoch, and the first batch labeled this way raises one
    :class:`UserWarning` naming the fields it lacked.

    Teacher conservativeness is not validated: a teacher predicting forces from
    its own head is first class, since every signal is detached before the
    student sees it. A teacher composition planning more than one neighbor-list
    source is refused, as by
    :class:`~nvalchemi.training.distillation.InProcessTeacherScorer`.

    The labeling hook is never serialized; :meth:`from_spec_dict` and
    :meth:`load_checkpoint` re-register it ahead of the caller's hooks and
    replace any carried copy. ``ValidationConfig(use_ema="auto")`` validates
    the EMA student against the live teacher (``model_source="mixed"``), while
    ``use_ema="always"`` also demands an inference-slot entry for the teacher.
    Checkpoints serialize every model, teacher included, so size the checkpoint
    interval for a large teacher.

    ``on_policy`` and ``reference_dataset`` hold live runtime objects that no
    spec can describe. :meth:`to_spec_dict` therefore omits them and warns. A
    strategy rebuilt from such a spec runs offline until they are supplied
    again. :meth:`from_spec_dict`, :meth:`from_checkpoint_dict`, and
    :meth:`load_checkpoint` accept them, together with the ``models`` the
    propagator holds. A strategy with a Boltzmann term refuses to rebuild
    without the loop, so for it the re-supply is mandatory.

        Without ``on_policy``, this is
        :meth:`~nvalchemi.training.TrainingStrategy.run` over *dataloader*.
        With ``on_policy``, the strategy owns the loop and repeats three phases
        until ``num_steps`` optimizer steps have run. In the *generate* phase,
        the propagator advances the live state batch by ``generation_steps``
        steps; on the first segment, the state is seeded from
        ``initial_structures``. In the *label and capture* phase, a
        :class:`~nvalchemi.training.distillation.TeacherLabelHook` registered
        on the propagator labels every ``label_frequency`` steps and the
        segment's last frame. It copies each labeled frame into the capture
        sink, which is drained into the replay buffer. The capture sink is host
        memory unless ``capture_sink`` names another. In the *train* phase, a
        freshly built mixed loader draws ``training_steps_per_segment`` batches
        at ``replay_ratio``, and each batch goes through the ordinary
        per-batch stages.

        For relaxation propagators, whose trajectories end, an
        ``OnPolicyConfig.fmax`` threshold adds a fourth phase between
        generation and training: *graduate and backfill*. Converged structures
        are stored once, as the minimum they reached. They then leave the
        batch and are replaced by fresh initial structures while the source
        still holds any. Generation stops once the source runs dry and the last
        trajectory finishes. The remaining steps train on the frames already
        in the buffer.

        Parameters
        ----------
        dataloader : Iterable[Batch] | None, optional
            Batches to train on in offline mode. Default ``None``, which is
            required in on-policy mode and rejected otherwise.

        Raises
        ------
        ValueError
            If *dataloader* is ``None`` in offline mode or supplied in on-policy
            mode, if a multi-rank launch has fewer initial structures than
            ranks or leaves the student unsynchronized, if a segment's loader
            produces no batches, if the propagator already carries a
            status-migrating criterion or a sampler of its own, or if the
            configured criterion migrates off a status no initial structure
            carries.

        Warns
        -----
        UserWarning
            If a lifecycle-managed run runs out of trajectories and initial
            structures before reaching ``num_steps``. The remaining steps then
            train on the frames already generated. Also once per segment
            boundary that retires trajectories the ``divergence`` predicate
            flagged, by default those whose positions or forces stopped
            being finite. Also if a multi-rank run cannot deal its initial
            structures out in equal shares, or if its propagator holds
            randomness that the rank offsets cannot separate.

        Notes
        -----
        One segment is one epoch. ``AFTER_EPOCH`` and epoch-cadence validation
        fire at segment boundaries, and step-cadence validation fires inside
        segments. The run closes with one final validation unless a cadence
        already validated at the final step. The segment is also the restart
        granularity. The propagator state is not checkpointed. A resumed run
        reseeds its trajectory, and a segment that a checkpoint interrupted is
        counted as finished on resume. A second call keeps the replay buffer
        the first call filled and reseeds only the trajectory.

        The student generates in evaluation mode and trains in training mode.
        A propagator model that merely composes the student is held in
        evaluation mode for the whole loop. Every mode is restored on exit.
        Generated frames are staged on ``reference_dataset``'s device unless
        ``replay_device`` names another. Splitting a built-in propagator's run
        into segments is exact, because ``run`` never resets ``step_count`` and
        the Langevin thermostat's generator is keyed on it. The progress of a
        segment that exits early is read from ``dynamics.step_count``. A
        :class:`~nvalchemi.dynamics.FusedStage` pays its priming forward pass
        once per segment.

        Across ranks, the loop is data-parallel. Each rank propagates its own
        strided shard of ``initial_structures``, labels the generated frames
        with its own teacher replica, and fills its own replay buffer. The
        reference dataset stays replicated, and every rank draws from all of it
        under a rank-offset ``seed``. The same offset moves every
        ``random_seed`` that the propagator and its sub-stages expose, through
        :meth:`~nvalchemi.dynamics.BaseDynamics.seed_offset`. A stage that
        holds randomness the offset cannot move is named in a warning. The
        student's gradient all-reduce, installed by a
        :class:`~nvalchemi.training.hooks.DDPHook`, is the only per-step
        training traffic between ranks. Setup adds small collectives, which
        check the shards and the replay placement, and validation all-reduces
        its metrics. The teacher never joins a collective. Every rank runs the
        same number of segments and batches, so the ranks reach each
        all-reduce together. A launch with fewer initial structures than ranks
        is refused before any segment runs, and so is one whose student
        nothing wraps, unless ``require_wrapped_student=False`` waives that
        check for a wrapper that works in place. See
        :ref:`training-distillation-api` for the mixture and schema contract
        and the scale-out runbook.

        Relaxation runs are the reason a segment can exit early, and
        ``OnPolicyConfig.fmax`` turns such a run into a lifecycle. For the
        duration of the loop, the criterion is registered ahead of the labeling
        hook and installed as the propagator's convergence detector. A
        converged structure is captured once, on the step its ``status``
        reaches ``exit_status``, and left out of every later path capture. At
        the segment boundary, initial structures are drawn to fill the room the
        graduates freed. A budgeted
        :class:`~nvalchemi.training.distillation.InitialStructures` draws them
        from the rows it has not served yet. An unbudgeted one draws them only
        with ``recycle=True``; otherwise the batch narrows. Once no trajectory
        is left and no initial structure remains to start one, the loop warns
        and trains on the buffer it has until ``num_steps``.

        private replica on every rank, each rank trains and generates from a
        different policy, and only rank zero's is checkpointed.

        Called after the ``SETUP`` stage, which is where a

        A ``strategy_cls`` naming a subclass dispatches to that class's own

        strategy a spec names is the one that runs; a subclass adding a runtime

        only when it is set, so a subclass overriding ``from_spec_dict`` without
        it still rebuilds from a plain spec.

        ``on_policy`` and ``reference_dataset`` must be passed with the

        models : BaseModelMixin | dict[str, BaseModelMixin] | None, optional
            Runtime model override(s). Distillation models are not serialized
            in full, so the student and teacher are normally re-supplied here.
        hooks : Sequence[Any] | None, optional
            Runtime hooks; defaults to an empty list.
        training_fn : Any, optional
            Runtime callable or dotted-path override.
        validation_config : ValidationConfig | None, optional
            Runtime validation configuration. Specs exclude it because it
            carries a live loader, so a validation-only ``teacher_*`` target is
            resolved by passing the config here rather than assigning it
            afterwards, which re-runs no validator.
        on_policy : OnPolicyConfig | None, optional
            Segment loop to rebuild the run with, built around the supplied
            student. Default ``None`` rebuilds an offline run.
        reference_dataset : BatchDatasetProtocol | None, optional

            ``None``.

        It extends
        :meth:`~nvalchemi.training.TrainingStrategy.from_checkpoint_dict` by
        forwarding the runtime objects that :meth:`to_spec_dict` cannot carry
        to :meth:`from_spec_dict` as runtime overrides. Only the overrides that
        are set are forwarded, so a subclass whose ``from_spec_dict`` lacks one
        of them still rebuilds.

        Parameters
        ----------
        spec : Mapping[str, Any]
            A dict produced by :meth:`to_checkpoint_dict`.
        models : BaseModelMixin | dict[str, BaseModelMixin] | None, optional
            Runtime model override(s), normally the models loaded from the
            checkpoint weight files.
        hooks : Sequence[Any] | None, optional
            Runtime hooks appended by the caller.
        training_fn : Any, optional
            Runtime callable or dotted-path override.
        validation_config : ValidationConfig | None, optional
            Runtime validation configuration. Specs exclude it because it
            carries a live loader, so a validation-only ``teacher_*`` target is
            resolved by passing the config here rather than assigning it
            afterwards, which re-runs no validator.
        on_policy : OnPolicyConfig | None, optional
            Segment loop to rebuild the run with, built around the supplied
            student. Default ``None`` rebuilds an offline run.
        reference_dataset : BatchDatasetProtocol | None, optional
            Reference dataset the segment loop mixes into every batch. Default
            ``None``.
        **runtime_overrides : Any
            Further keyword arguments a subclass's ``from_spec_dict`` accepts.

        Returns
        -------
        DistillationStrategy
            A strategy with declarative fields and restart counters restored.

        It extends :meth:`~nvalchemi.training.TrainingStrategy.load_checkpoint`
        with the runtime objects a distillation spec cannot describe.
        They reach :meth:`from_spec_dict` as runtime overrides that the loader
        forwards. The segment loop is tied to the student it propagates, so
        *models* is re-supplied alongside *on_policy*, and the checkpoint's
        weights are loaded into those models. A strategy with a Boltzmann term
        refuses to rebuild without the loop.

        Parameters
        ----------
        root_folder : Path | str
            Root directory containing checkpoint files.
        checkpoint_index : int, optional
            Checkpoint index to load. ``-1`` loads the latest manifest index.
        map_location : str | torch.device | None, optional
            Device override passed through to :func:`torch.load` and the
            restored strategy metadata.
        models : BaseModelMixin | dict[str, BaseModelMixin] | None, optional
            Models to restore the checkpoint's weights into, in place of the
            ones the loader builds from the saved specs: the objects the
            segment loop's propagator holds. Default ``None``.
        hooks : Sequence[Any] | None, optional
            Runtime hooks to attach to the restored strategy.
        training_fn : Any, optional
            Runtime training function override.
        validators : Sequence[Any] | None, optional
            Loaded-checkpoint validators forwarded to the lower-level loader.
        validation_config : ValidationConfig | None, optional
            Runtime validation configuration. Specs exclude it because it

            afterwards, which re-runs no validator.
        on_policy : OnPolicyConfig | None, optional
            Segment loop to restore the run with. Default ``None`` restores an
            offline run.

            Reference dataset the segment loop mixes into every batch. Default
