class TeacherLabelHook:
    """Label the live propagator frame with teacher signals, inline.

    The hook runs at ``AFTER_STEP``. It attaches every signal its scorer
    produces to the batch being propagated, each at the level its signal
    declares. It can also copy the labeled frame into a
    :class:`~nvalchemi.dynamics.sinks.DataSink`. The live batch keeps the
    ``energy`` and ``forces`` the propagator wrote, because they drive the
    next step. The copy drops them, the ephemeral neighbor tensors, and the
    dynamics bookkeeping. A stored frame is therefore a training sample rather
    than a propagator state, and it never carries the propagated model's own
    prediction under a reference target's name. A scorer that declares or
    returns a field outside ``teacher_*`` is rejected, so it cannot overwrite
    propagator state.

    With ``exit_status`` set, graphs whose ``status`` has reached it are left
    out of that copy and out of the teacher pass that labels it. A lifecycle
    freezes those graphs at ``exit_status`` and stores each one once, through
    a separate converged-frame route. Capturing them here would store and
    score the same structure again on every later capture of the segment.
    The hook records which graphs it stored on which step. The
    converged-frame route asks :meth:`stored_graphs` before it writes, so a
    structure that a step budget graduates right after this hook stored its
    frame is not stored twice. Without ``exit_status``, every graph is
    captured, frozen or not, because nothing else keeps the final frame of a
    graduation the propagator manages itself. A frame that carries no
    ``status`` is labeled and captured whole either way, and a hook without a
    sink labels every frame whole.

    Labeling is idempotent per step. A cadence dispatch right after a forced
    label is skipped, so the teacher is not paid twice for a segment's last
    frame and the next cadence step. See :ref:`training-distillation-api`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    teacher_scorer : TeacherScorer
        Scorer that produces the teacher signals. A scorer that publishes
        ``label_fields`` makes the idempotency check exact from the first
        dispatch.
    sink : DataSink | None, optional
        Sink each labeled frame is copied into. Default ``None``.
    frequency : int, optional
        Label every ``frequency`` steps. Default ``1``.
    exit_status : int | None, optional
        Propagator status at which a graph counts as graduated. A graduated
        graph is stored by another route, so this hook leaves it out. Default
        ``None`` labels and stores every graph.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If the scorer declares, or returns, a field outside ``teacher_*``.

    Notes
    -----
    This hook is not the labeling seam inside
    :class:`~nvalchemi.training.distillation.DistillationStrategy`, which is a
    training hook that labels batches on their way into a forward pass. The
    two run on different engines, and both are active in an on-policy run.
    Label precision is the scorer's decision, and the hook opens no autocast
    region of its own. The built-in scorer disables autocast unless its
    ``autocast`` setting says otherwise, so a frame it labels during a
    mixed-precision generation phase matches what
    :func:`~nvalchemi.training.distillation.label_dataset` writes offline.
    ``requires_grad`` handling is the scorer's responsibility, and the scorer
    leaves the batch as :meth:`~nvalchemi.dynamics.base.BaseDynamics.compute`
    left it.
