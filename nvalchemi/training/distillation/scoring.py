class TeacherSignal:
    """Model output, batch field, level, and shape rule behind one teacher signal.

    A signal names what the teacher produces — *model_output*, a key in its
    outputs — and where the label lands: *field*, at *level*. A signal with
    ``model_output=None`` is one the scorer derives outside the forward pass,
    such as the built-in ``embeddings`` through
    :meth:`~nvalchemi.models.base.BaseModelMixin.compute_embeddings`; a custom
    signal must name an output. Pass an instance to
    :class:`InProcessTeacherScorer` beside the built-in names to label a
    teacher output the built-in table does not cover.

    Parameters
    ----------
    name : str
        Signal name, as a scorer is asked for it.
    model_output : str | None
        Key of the teacher output the label is read from, or ``None`` for a
        signal the scorer derives by a route of its own.
    field : str
        Batch field the label populates; must start with ``teacher_``.
    level : SignalLevel
        ``"node"`` for one row per atom, ``"system"`` for one per graph.
    normalize : SignalNormalizer | None, optional
        Reshapes the detached raw output to the field's canonical shape, given
        the batch it was produced for. For a signal with companion fields, it
        instead returns a mapping from every name in :attr:`fields` to its
        tensor, all at *level*. Default ``None`` (keep the shape).
    extra_fields : tuple[str, ...], optional
        Companion fields the signal writes beside *field*, each in the
        ``teacher_*`` namespace and produced by *normalize*. Default ``()``.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If *field* or a companion field falls outside the ``teacher_*``
        namespace, if *level* is neither ``"node"`` nor ``"system"``, or if a
        signal read from a model output declares companion fields without a
        *normalize* to produce them.

    Both are undone by recording every stored field and every shadow by
    reference — no tensor is copied, so the cost is one dictionary per level —
    and afterwards dropping what appeared and putting back what was replaced.
    A field the teacher deleted outright is re-added at the level it came
    from. A level the teacher detached wholesale, such as ``edges``, is
    re-attached from the same snapshot first. A tensor a teacher edits in
    place is not recovered; nothing short of cloning the batch could.

    """Structural interface for objects that produce teacher signals for a batch.

    An implementation declares the ``signals`` it emits and returns, for one

    levels ``"node"`` or ``"system"`` as :meth:`~nvalchemi.data.Batch.add_key`
    takes them. Tensors must be detached and live on the batch's device.

    It may also publish ``label_fields``, the sequence of batch fields
    :meth:`label` populates (never a bare string); consumers read it through
    :func:`scorer_fields`. An implementation naming a built-in signal is read
    as writing every field that signal populates, so one that writes fewer,
    or one whose signals are its own, must declare ``label_fields``. The
    protocol will not grow required members.

    Label precision is the scorer's decision. A consumer calls :meth:`label`
    inside the ambient autocast region, meaning whatever autocast state is in
    force at the call site, and opens no region of its own. An implementation
    used in a mixed-precision workflow therefore sets its own autocast mode.

class InProcessTeacherScorer:
    """Score a batch with a teacher model loaded in the current process.

    The scorer owns the teacher's evaluation contract: it narrows
    ``active_outputs`` to the outputs the requested signals need, builds and
    afterwards restores whatever neighbor list the teacher requires — or, on
    request, consumes the one the batch already carries — picks the grad mode
    the teacher's autograd outputs need, runs the pass under its ``autocast``
    setting, detaches every result, and normalizes each signal to its
    canonical shape. The batch is left exactly as it was found, so a scorer
    can be called mid-training on a live batch.

    Each signal is a :class:`TeacherSignal` mapping one teacher output to one
    batch field at one level. The built-in ones (:data:`BUILTIN_SIGNALS`) are
    requested by name: ``energy`` to ``teacher_energy`` ``(B, 1)`` and
    ``stress`` to ``teacher_stress`` ``(B, 3, 3)`` at system level;
    ``forces`` to ``teacher_forces`` ``(V, 3)``, ``atomic_energies`` to
    ``teacher_atomic_energies`` ``(V,)``, ``embeddings`` (from
    :meth:`~nvalchemi.models.base.BaseModelMixin.compute_embeddings`) to
    ``teacher_node_embeddings`` ``(V, D)``, and ``hessian`` (from
    :meth:`label_hvp`) to ``teacher_hvp`` ``(V, 3)`` at node level. The
    ``hessian`` signal is the teacher's Hessian-vector product, the product of
    its energy Hessian with a random probe direction; that direction is
    written to ``teacher_hvp_probe``. Any other teacher output is requested as
    a :class:`TeacherSignal` of its own. The resolved specs are published as
    ``signal_specs`` and the fields they write as ``label_fields``.

    Parameters
    ----------
    teacher : BaseModelMixin
        Model wrapper producing the signals. Placed in evaluation mode at
        construction and for the duration of every :meth:`label` call, with
        the mode it arrived in restored afterwards; its parameters and their
        ``requires_grad`` flags are never modified.
    signals : Iterable[str | TeacherSignal]
        Signals to produce: built-in names or :class:`TeacherSignal` specs,
        each naming an output in the teacher's declared ``outputs``.
    dtype : torch.dtype | None, optional
        Cast floating-point outputs to this dtype. Any floating-point dtype is
        accepted; whether a store can hold it is checked by
        :func:`~nvalchemi.training.distillation.labeling.label_dataset`, and a
        labeled store reads back at the reading dataset's ``positions`` dtype
        regardless. Default ``None`` (keep the teacher's dtype).
    neighbor_list : NeighborListPolicy, optional
        ``"rebuild"`` builds the teacher's own neighbor list for every call,
        hiding whatever list the batch carries, and rolls it back afterwards.
        ``"reuse"`` hands the teacher the batch's list instead: the batch must
        carry the keys the teacher's format reads, and a cutoff stamp, when
        the batch has one, must equal the teacher's; otherwise :meth:`label`
        raises rather than falling back. Whether the list holds each pair once
        or twice is not recorded on the batch, so a reused list must match the
        teacher's ``half_list`` by construction. Default ``"rebuild"``.
    autocast : bool | torch.dtype | None, optional
        Autocast mode for the scoring pass. The ambient autocast region is
        whatever autocast state is in force where :meth:`label` is called,
        such as a caller's AMP region. ``False`` disables autocast for the
        pass, so an ambient region never reaches the teacher. ``None`` leaves
        the ambient state untouched, so the teacher runs under the caller's
        region when one is open. ``True`` or a floating-point ``torch.dtype``
        enables autocast for the pass, whether or not an ambient region is
        open: a dtype sets the autocast dtype, and ``True`` keeps the autocast
        dtype in force for the device, which is the device default when no
        region is open and the ambient region's dtype when one is. *dtype*
        applies after this setting: the teacher produces each label at the
        precision this mode gives, and *dtype*, when set, then casts it.
        Default ``False``.
    probe_seed : int | None, optional
        Seed of the generator the ``hessian`` probe direction is drawn from.
        Default ``None`` draws from the global RNG, a fresh direction per
        labeling. A call to :meth:`label` can override it for that labeling
        alone; see the Notes.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If *signals* is empty, names a signal that is neither built in nor a
        :class:`TeacherSignal`, gives two specs one name or one field, names a
        model output the teacher does not declare, gives a custom spec no
        model output, requests ``"embeddings"`` from a teacher that publishes
        no node-embedding shape, requests ``"hessian"`` from a teacher that
        declares no ``energy`` output, *dtype* is not a floating-point dtype,
        *neighbor_list* is neither ``"rebuild"`` nor ``"reuse"``, *autocast*
        is neither ``None``, a bool, nor a floating-point dtype, or *teacher*
        is a composition planning more than one neighbor-list source.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> from nvalchemi.training.distillation import InProcessTeacherScorer
    >>> scorer = InProcessTeacherScorer(teacher, ["energy", "forces"])  # doctest: +SKIP
    >>> labels = scorer.label(batch)  # doctest: +SKIP
    >>> labels["teacher_forces"][1]  # doctest: +SKIP
    'node'

    A teacher output the built-in table does not cover is labeled through a
    spec of its own:

    >>> from nvalchemi.training.distillation import TeacherSignal
    >>> charges = TeacherSignal("charges", "charges", "teacher_charges", "node")
    >>> scorer = InProcessTeacherScorer(teacher, ["energy", charges])  # doctest: +SKIP
    >>> scorer.label_fields  # doctest: +SKIP
    ('teacher_charges', 'teacher_energy')

    Notes
    -----
    Under the default ``neighbor_list="rebuild"`` the teacher's list is built
    for the forward pass and rolled back, and a list a composed pipeline keeps
    as an instance attribute, along with its captured per-source table, is
    hidden from the teacher for the whole of scoring. ``"reuse"`` is for the
    case where the student has already built the list the teacher needs, in
    the teacher's format and at its cutoff, and one build per step is one too
    many; the scorer then checks only what it cannot infer and refuses the
    batch by name when the list is missing or stamped with another cutoff. A
    teacher composition planning more than one neighbor-list source is refused
    at construction, because the scorer builds one list per batch; compose it
    to plan a single list instead (``neighbor_adaptation="always"`` or a large
    enough ``max_cutoff_ratio``).
    ``requires_grad`` on ``positions`` and the teacher's autograd inputs is
    restored after each call, as is every field a composed teacher writes onto
    the batch to wire one stage into the next.

    Label precision is the scorer's decision. Every consumer in the package
    calls :meth:`label` inside the ambient autocast region and opens none of
    its own, so the *autocast* setting decides which autocast mode the teacher
    runs under. The default disables autocast, so a label taken during a
    mixed-precision training or generation phase equals the one
    :func:`~nvalchemi.training.distillation.label_dataset` writes offline.
    Inside a caller's region, ``True`` and a dtype differ: ``True`` enables
    autocast at the region's dtype, whereas a dtype pins the pass to itself.

    Forward-pass signals share one teacher pass. ``embeddings`` adds a second
    pass, and ``hessian`` adds an energy-only pass plus two backward passes, so
    a Hessian label costs roughly three to four times an energy-and-force
    label. Each redrawn probe is a new objective. Leave ``probe_seed`` unset
    wherever coverage of the Hessian comes from redrawing, as in training and
    offline labeling. Pin it wherever a number is compared across passes, as
    :class:`~nvalchemi.training.distillation.DistillationStrategy` does per
    validation batch through the call-time ``probe_seed`` of :meth:`label`.

        The teacher's energy is differentiated twice with respect to the

        the same ``autocast`` setting and the same neighbor-list and field
        isolation as :meth:`label`. The batch is left as it was found,
        including a composed teacher's wired intermediates and swapped
        autograd leaves.

        Parameters
        ----------
        batch : Batch
            Batch to differentiate the teacher's energy on.
        probe : NodePositions
            Probe direction of shape ``(V, 3)``, matching the batch's positions.

        Returns
        -------
        Forces
            Detached Hessian-vector product of shape ``(V, 3)``, cast to
            ``dtype`` when one is configured.

        Raises
        ------
        RuntimeError
            If the teacher returns no energy, or is not twice differentiable
            with respect to positions.

        Examples
        --------
        >>> import torch
        >>> from nvalchemi.training.distillation import InProcessTeacherScorer
        >>> scorer = InProcessTeacherScorer(teacher, ["hessian"])  # doctest: +SKIP
        >>> probe = torch.randn_like(batch.positions)  # doctest: +SKIP
        >>> scorer.label_hvp(batch, probe).shape  # doctest: +SKIP
        torch.Size([12, 3])

        Notes
        -----
        One product costs one forward and two backward passes. A Hutchinson
        average over ``k`` probes takes ``k`` calls. That average is left to the
        caller, because the loss consumes one materialized target per batch.
