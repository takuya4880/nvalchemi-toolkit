class HessianMatchingLoss(BaseLossFunction):
    r"""Mean-squared-error loss on Hessian-vector products.

    Energies and forces pin down the value and slope of the student's
    potential-energy surface. Its curvature decides vibrational spectra, the
    stiffness of a minimum, and whether an integrator stays stable at a given
    timestep. This term supervises that curvature without forming a Hessian.
    It compares the teacher's and student's Hessian-vector products, the
    product of each model's energy Hessian with one random probe direction
    :math:`\mathbf{v}`. The per-component residual is

    .. math::

        \rho_{ia\alpha} = \left(
        (\hat{\mathbf{H}}\mathbf{v})_{ia\alpha} -
        (\mathbf{H}\mathbf{v})_{ia\alpha} \right)^2,

    and each product costs two backward passes per model rather than
    :math:`3V`. The residuals are reduced the way force residuals are,
    according to ``normalize_by_atom_count``. The ``hessian`` teacher signal
    writes the teacher's product to ``teacher_hvp`` and the probe to
    ``teacher_hvp_probe``.
    :func:`~nvalchemi.training.distillation.hessian_distillation_fn` computes
    the student's product along that same probe.

    Parameters
    ----------
    target_key : str, default "teacher_hvp"
        Target container key for the teacher's Hessian-vector product.
    prediction_key : str, default "predicted_hvp"
        Prediction container key for the student's Hessian-vector product.
    normalize_by_atom_count : bool, default True
        When ``True``, compute a mean squared residual per graph, then mean
        over graphs. When ``False``, compute one global mean over valid
        components.
    ignore_nonfinite : bool, default True
        When ``True``, components whose target is ``NaN`` or infinite are
        excluded from both loss value and gradient. It defaults on because a
        marginally stable model overflows first in its second derivatives.
    dtype_policy : {"strict", "prediction_to_target", "target_to_prediction"}, default "strict"
        How to handle prediction/target dtype mismatches before validation.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If the graph-balanced reduction is requested without ``batch_idx`` and
        ``num_graphs`` metadata.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> import torch
    >>> from nvalchemi.training.distillation import HessianMatchingLoss
    >>> loss_fn = HessianMatchingLoss()
    >>> pred = torch.tensor([[2.0, 0.0, 0.0], [0.0, 0.0, 0.0]])
    >>> target = torch.zeros(2, 3)
    >>> batch_idx = torch.tensor([0, 1])
    >>> loss_fn(pred, target, batch_idx=batch_idx, num_graphs=2)
    tensor(0.6667)

    --------
    nvalchemi.training.distillation.hessian_vector_product : The shared estimator.

    Notes
    -----
    ``requires_eval_grad`` is ``True`` because the prediction is a second
    derivative. Validation therefore runs with gradients enabled and costs the
    same two student passes as a training step. One probe constrains one
    direction, so coverage of the curvature comes from redrawing the probe. An
    on-policy run draws a fresh probe every time it labels a frame, whereas a
    store labeled once freezes one direction per structure.

    Each probe component is standard normal, which makes the graph-balanced
    value a Hutchinson estimate of
    :math:`\frac{1}{B}\sum_g \lVert \Delta\mathbf{H}_g \rVert_F^2 / 3V_g` in
    (eV/A^2)^2. For a near-converged student, this value is one to two orders
    of magnitude above the force mean-squared error. It is also a one-sample
    estimate whose relative spread is of order one. Start the term a hundred to
    ten thousand times lighter than the force term, and treat a single batch's
    value as noise.

    The term matches the curvature of the *energy*. A direct-force model,
    teacher or student, has a well-defined energy Hessian, but that Hessian is
    not the derivative of the forces distilled beside it. For a direct-force
    student, the term therefore supervises the energy head alone.
