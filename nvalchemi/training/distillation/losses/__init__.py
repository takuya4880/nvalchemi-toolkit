"""Loss terms that compare a student against teacher signals.

The built-in terms in :mod:`nvalchemi.training.losses` already cover every
teacher signal that has a total-energy, force, or stress shape — point their
``target_key`` at the matching ``teacher_*`` field. This subpackage adds the
terms that have no supervised counterpart: the teacher's per-atom energy
decomposition, its per-atom representations, the curvature of its energy
surface, and the Boltzmann distribution its energies define.
