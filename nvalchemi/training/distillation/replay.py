    The buffer wraps an
    :class:`~nvalchemi.data.datapipes.in_memory_dataset.InMemoryDataset` that

    :class:`~nvalchemi.data.datapipes.multidataset.MultiDataset` consumes it
    like any dataset. The first :meth:`extend` freezes the incoming schema,
    including levels and dtypes, and every later call must match it exactly.
    :meth:`~nvalchemi.data.Batch.append` keeps only the keys both sides hold
    and casts what it keeps to the resident dtypes. Without the frozen schema,
    one unlabeled frame would strip ``teacher_*`` from every frame already
    stored, and one arriving in a wider dtype would have its labels rounded to
    the resident dtype unreported.

    A stored frame is a training sample rather than a propagator state. It
    holds the structure and its ``teacher_*`` labels, and none of the
    predictions the propagator wrote.
    :class:`~nvalchemi.training.distillation.TeacherLabelHook` delivers frames
    in this shape, and :func:`build_mixed_loader` requires the reference
    dataset to match it. Two decisions are left to policy: what enters the
    buffer and what leaves it. An :class:`AdmissionPolicy` masks the incoming
    frames before the schema check. When the buffer is over capacity, an
    :class:`EvictionPolicy` names the frames to drop. The default is
    :class:`FIFO`, which drops the oldest frames first.

    Parameters
    ----------
    capacity : int | None, optional
        Maximum number of frames kept. Bound it on long runs. Also bound it on
        any run whose objective reads a batch as a sample of the current
        policy, because a draw over a buffer that never retires frames is a
        draw over every policy the run has had. Default ``None`` (unbounded).
    eviction : {"fifo"} | EvictionPolicy, optional
        Policy deciding which frames leave a full buffer. Default ``"fifo"``,
        which builds :class:`FIFO`.
    admission : AdmissionPolicy | None, optional
        Predicate that selects which frames each :meth:`extend` admits.
        Default ``None`` admits every frame.
    device : torch.device | str | None, optional
        Device the buffer keeps frames on and emits them from. A segment loop
        sets it from ``OnPolicyConfig.replay_device``. Default ``None`` adopts
        the device of the first frames passed to :meth:`extend` and moves every
        later frame to that device, so two capture routes on two devices can
        fill one buffer.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If *capacity* is not positive, or if *eviction* is a string other than
        ``"fifo"``.
    TypeError
        If *eviction* is neither that string nor an object with ``select``, or
        if *admission* is not callable.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> from nvalchemi.training.distillation import ReplayBuffer
    >>> buffer = ReplayBuffer(capacity=4096)
    >>> buffer.extend(labeled_frames)  # doctest: +SKIP
    >>> len(buffer)  # doctest: +SKIP
    128

    Notes
    -----
    Frames are owned, not aliased. The buffer copies the batch that first
    fills it and concatenates later batches into fresh tensors. A propagator
    may therefore keep integrating the batch it handed over.

    """Build a loader that draws a fixed reference/replay mixture in every batch.

    The two sources are composed into a
    :class:`~nvalchemi.data.datapipes.multidataset.MultiDataset` and drawn by a
    :class:`~nvalchemi.data.datapipes.samplers.MultiDatasetBatchSampler`. The
    ratio is resolved to whole samples of *batch_size*, so every batch has
    exactly the same composition, at a granularity of ``1 / batch_size``. For
    example, ``replay_ratio=0.25`` and ``batch_size=8`` give six reference and
    two replay samples every step. Rebuild the loader after every segment.
    The sampler reads the child dataset lengths once, at construction, so it
    never samples frames added later.

    Parameters
    ----------
    reference_dataset : BatchDatasetProtocol | None
        Reference dataset, typically a teacher-labeled store. ``None`` trains on
        generated data only and requires ``replay_ratio=1.0``.
    replay_buffer : ReplayBuffer
        Buffer of generated frames. When it is empty, the loader draws from
        the reference dataset only.
    replay_ratio : float
        Fraction of every batch drawn from *replay_buffer*, in ``[0, 1]``.
    batch_size : int
        Samples per batch across both sources.
    num_batches : int | None, optional
        Batches per epoch, honored on every path, including the single-source
        ones. Default ``None`` uses the sampler's ``"dataset_size"`` policy,
        or one pass over a single source.
    shuffle : bool, optional
        Randomize sample order within each child and each batch. Default
        ``True``.
    generator : torch.Generator | None, optional
        Generator for reproducible mixing. A single-source loader without
        *num_batches* draws from the global RNG instead. Default ``None``.
    seed : int, optional
        Base seed of the batch sampler when it owns its generator. The sampler
        combines it with the epoch set on it. Default ``0``.

    Returns
    -------
    DataLoader
        Loader yielding :class:`~nvalchemi.data.Batch` objects of the requested
        composition.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If *replay_ratio* is outside ``[0, 1]``, if both sources are empty, if
        *reference_dataset* is ``None`` while ``replay_ratio < 1``, if the two
        sources differ in batch levels, fields, a field's dtype, or emission
        device, or if the ratio allocates no samples to one of them.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> from nvalchemi.training.distillation import build_mixed_loader
    >>> loader = build_mixed_loader(  # doctest: +SKIP
    ...     reference_dataset,
    ...     buffer,
    ...     replay_ratio=0.25,
    ...     batch_size=8,
    ...     num_batches=64,
    ... )

    Notes
    -----
    Collation is not a merge. :meth:`~nvalchemi.data.Batch.append` drops a
    field that only one side holds, and zero-fills a whole level that only one
    side holds. Both sources must therefore carry the same schema, which is
    compared on a probe batch from each. That schema is the replay-frame
    contract: the structure, the propagator state that travels with it, and
    the ``teacher_*`` labels. It has none of the ``energy``, ``forces``, or
    ``stress`` fields the labeling hook strips. A reference dataset that
    carries plain reference labels is therefore rejected. Label it with
    :func:`~nvalchemi.training.distillation.label_dataset`, requesting the
    signals the propagator's scorer produces. The sampler draws with
    replacement, so a buffer holding fewer frames than its allocation is
    oversampled.
