"""User-supplied data transforms for :mod:`nvalchemi.data`.

This package hosts composition infrastructure for transforms that plug
into :class:`~nvalchemi.data.Dataset` (per-sample transforms) and
:class:`~nvalchemi.data.DataLoader` (per-batch transforms), and is the
intended home for future concrete transform submodules
