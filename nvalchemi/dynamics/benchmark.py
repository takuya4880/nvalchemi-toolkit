    Attributes
    ----------
    steps_per_second : float
        Propagator steps completed per wall-clock second.
    atoms_per_second : float
        ``steps_per_second`` times the atom count of the measured batch. It
        depends on batch size: it climbs with the batch until the device
        saturates. It therefore ranks two students only when both were measured
        on the same batch.
    ns_per_day : float | None
        Simulated nanoseconds per wall-clock day. ``None`` when no timestep was
        supplied.
    num_atoms : int
        Atoms in the batch at the start of the measured window.
    num_graphs : int
        Graphs in the batch at the start of the measured window.
    warmup_steps, measured_steps : int
        Warmup steps run and discarded before timing, and steps actually
        executed inside the timed window. ``measured_steps`` is read from the
        propagator's own step counter.
    elapsed_seconds : float
        Wall-clock duration of the measured window.
    device : str
        Device the batch was propagated on.

    The measurement makes two chunked
    :meth:`~nvalchemi.dynamics.base.BaseDynamics.run` calls on the same live
    batch. The first is a discarded warmup, which absorbs the cost of the
    neighbor-list build, lazy state allocation, autotuning, and kernel
    compilation. The second is the timed window. The device is synchronized
    before the clock starts and before it stops, so the rate is the execution
    rate rather than the launch rate. The rate uses the change in the
    propagator's own ``step_count``, because a run stops early once every graph
    has converged. The atom count is read at the start of the window, so a
    propagator that graduates systems mid-window reports the rate it started
    with.

    Parameters
    ----------
    dynamics : BaseDynamics
        Propagator to time, with its model and hooks already attached.
    batch : Batch
        Batch to propagate. Advanced in place by up to ``warmup_steps +
        measured_steps`` steps, fewer if the propagator converges first.
    warmup_steps : int, optional
        Steps run and discarded before timing. Default ``5``.
    measured_steps : int, optional
        Steps requested inside the timed window. Default ``20``.
    timestep_fs : float | None, optional
        Integration timestep in femtoseconds, used to convert steps into
        simulated time. Pass the value the propagator was built with. Default
        ``None`` (``ns_per_day`` is left unreported).

    Returns
    -------
    ThroughputMetrics
        Rates measured over the timed window.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If ``measured_steps`` is not positive, if ``warmup_steps`` is negative,
        if ``timestep_fs`` is not positive, or if the propagator advanced no
        steps inside the window.
    RuntimeError
        If the propagator exhausted its sampler during the warmup, leaving no
        batch to time.

    Warns
    -----
    UserWarning
        If the propagator converged inside the timed window, so the rate covers
        fewer steps than requested and is not a steady-state figure.
