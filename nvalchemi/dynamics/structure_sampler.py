"""Ordered structure sampling for a propagator that admits structures over time.

A propagator run with in-flight batching reads structures at two points. It
reads them once to build the batch its first step propagates from. It reads
them again whenever a structure graduates and a fresh structure backfills the
room it frees. This module serves both reads from a single position over the
rows one rank owns. Each structure is therefore propagated once, and a restart
resumes where the run stopped. Whether a structure fits a batch is decided by
one :class:`FitPolicy` predicate rather than by a fixed set of budget
arguments.

    The reference :class:`StructureSource`, backed by a dataset. A run reads
    the sampler once to build the batch the first step propagates from. A
    driver layered on top then draws from it again to backfill each structure
    it graduates. Both reads advance the same position, so no structure is
    propagated twice within one pass over the rows. An *unbudgeted* sampler
    serves every row it owns as one batch, so the run has one trajectory per
    row. A *budgeted* sampler packs the initial batch while structures fit
    and leaves the remaining rows, in order, for :meth:`draw`. Either way, the
    initial batch is packed as one :meth:`draw` call with a
    :class:`WithinBudget` policy and ``on_miss="stop"`` would pack it. A
    backfill that fills the room a graduation freed passes its own policy
    with ``on_miss="skip"``.

    :meth:`shard` narrows the sampler to the rows one rank owns. The rows are
    dealt strided and unpadded, so the shards are disjoint and no structure is
    propagated twice. :attr:`next_row` counts positions in :attr:`rows`. A
    ``system_id`` is not a position: ids count only the structures the run
    has started, not the rows a policy passed over. :attr:`next_system_id` is
    therefore tracked separately from :attr:`next_row`.

    A sampler built with ``recycle=True`` never reports itself exhausted.
    When its position reaches the end of the shard, it wraps to the front, and
    :attr:`wraps` counts how often that happened. The ``system_id`` numbers
    keep increasing across a wrap. One :meth:`draw` reaches every row at most
    once, so a single call never serves two copies of one structure. Across
    calls there is no such guarantee: a trajectory that outlives a full pass
    over the shard shares the batch with a second copy of its structure.

    Parameters
    ----------
    dataset : BatchDatasetProtocol
        Structures, indexed in the order they are served.
    max_atoms : int | None, optional
        Total atoms the initial batch may hold. Default ``None`` puts no atom
        bound on it.
    max_edges : int | None, optional
        Total stored edges the initial batch may hold. Default ``None`` puts no
        edge bound on it.
    max_batch_size : int | None, optional
        Total structures the initial batch may hold. Default ``None`` puts no
        bound on the count. With all three ``None``, the sampler is unbudgeted
        and serves every row it owns as one batch.
    recycle : bool, optional
        Whether the position wraps to the front of the shard when it reaches
        the end, instead of the sampler reporting itself exhausted. Default
        ``False``.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
