Dynamics hooks for observation, safety, and behavior modification.

This sub-package provides concrete hook implementations that plug into the
:class:`~nvalchemi.dynamics.base.BaseDynamics` hook system.  Every class
satisfies the :class:`~nvalchemi.hooks.Hook` protocol and can be
registered with any dynamics engine via
:meth:`~nvalchemi.dynamics.base.BaseDynamics.register_hook`.

Hooks are organized into the following modules:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 20 80

   * - :mod:`snapshot`
     - Save batch state to a :class:`~nvalchemi.dynamics.sinks.DataSink`.
   * - :mod:`logging`
     - Log scalar observables (energy, temperature, fmax, etc.).
   * - :mod:`safety`
     - Numerical safety guards (NaN detection, force clamping).
   * - :mod:`monitors`
     - Long-running diagnostic monitors (energy drift, conservation series).
   * - :mod:`freeze`
     - Freeze selected atoms by category during dynamics.
   * - :mod:`cell_align`
     - Align periodic cells to upper-triangular form for variable-cell optimization.
   * - :mod:`nvalchemi.hooks.physicsnemo_profiling`
     - PyTorch profiler trace capture through PhysicsNeMo.

All hooks implement the :class:`~nvalchemi.hooks.Hook` protocol and accept
a :class:`~nvalchemi.hooks.DynamicsContext` plus a stage enum in their
``__call__`` method. The package also publishes ``KB_EV``, the Boltzmann
constant in eV/K that the temperature-reading hooks convert kinetic energies
with, for code that reduces energies by ``k_B T``.
