  How to distill a large teacher MLIP into a small student with
  DistillationStrategy — teacher signals and offline dataset labeling, the
  teacher_* loss targets, the on-policy segment loop (propagator, replay
  buffer, mixed loader), teacher weights stored once per checkpoint root and
  restart, accuracy/stability/throughput evaluation with acceptance
  thresholds, and the JSON recipe CLI. Use when training a small student to
  reproduce a big model's energies, forces, stress, or per-atom energies,
  generating training frames from the student's own trajectories, or gating a
  distilled student against acceptance bars.

# nvalchemi Distillation

## Overview

Distillation trains a small **student** to reproduce a large frozen
**teacher**. In `nvalchemi` it is a `TrainingStrategy` subclass over two named
models, so everything from `nvalchemi-training-api` applies: optimizers,
schedulers, validation, hooks, checkpoints, DDP. What distillation adds is a
teacher whose outputs become loss *targets*.

Read `nvalchemi-training-api` and `nvalchemi-loss-api` first. Deeper details
live in `docs/userguide/distillation_recipes.md` and
`docs/modules/training/distillation.rst`.

```python
import torch

from nvalchemi.dynamics.integrators.nvt_langevin import NVTLangevin
from nvalchemi.training import (
    ComposedLossFunction,
    EnergyMSELoss,
    ForceMSELoss,
    OptimizerConfig,
)
from nvalchemi.training.distillation import (
    DistillationStrategy,
    InProcessTeacherScorer,
    OnPolicyConfig,
    OnPolicySettings,
    AtomicEnergyMatchingLoss,
    ReplayBuffer,
    InitialStructures,
    TeacherLabelHook,
    build_mixed_loader,
    default_distillation_fn,
    label_dataset,
)
```

Two loops are available:

- **Offline** — train over a fixed dataset, with the teacher's labels either
  precomputed into a store or produced on the fly. Start here; it distributes
  over ranks like ordinary training.
- **On-policy** — generate frames by running dynamics with the student itself,
  label them with the teacher, and train on a mixture of those and reference
  data. Use it when the student is stable on the reference distribution but
  fails on the states it actually visits.

---

## Minimal Pattern (offline)

```python
strategy = DistillationStrategy(
    models={"student": student, "teacher": teacher},
    optimizer_configs={
        "student": [
            OptimizerConfig(
                optimizer_cls=torch.optim.AdamW,
                optimizer_kwargs={"lr": 1e-4, "weight_decay": 1e-6},
            )
        ]
    },
    loss_fn=EnergyMSELoss(target_key="teacher_energy")
    + 10.0 * ForceMSELoss(target_key="teacher_forces"),
    num_steps=10_000,
)
strategy.run(dataloader)
```

Three rules govern the shape of that call:

- **The teacher is frozen by omission.** Give `optimizer_configs` a `"student"`
  entry and no `"teacher"` entry. Adding one is an error, not a way to train
  both.
- **The model names are fixed.** `"student"` and `"teacher"` are required keys.
- **Teacher signals are derived, not declared.** The strategy reads the
  `teacher_*` `target_key`s out of the loss and asks the teacher for exactly
  those signals, validating them against the teacher's declared outputs at
  construction. Only set `teacher_signals=` to request a signal no loss term
  consumes.

`training_fn` defaults to `default_distillation_fn`, a plain student forward.
Its `predicted_*` keys are checked at construction against the student's
`active_outputs`, so a narrowed student is caught before the run.

---

## Teacher Signals

A scorer turns a `Batch` into named signals, each mapped to a batch field:

| Signal | Batch field | Level |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `energy` | `teacher_energy` | system |
| `forces` | `teacher_forces` | node |
| `stress` | `teacher_stress` | system |
| `atomic_energies` | `teacher_atomic_energies` | node |
| `embeddings` | `teacher_node_embeddings` | node |
| `hessian` | `teacher_hvp` + `teacher_hvp_probe` | node |

`InProcessTeacherScorer(teacher, signals, *, dtype=None, probe_seed=None,
neighbor_list="rebuild")` evaluates a teacher loaded in the current process.
`signals` mixes built-in names with `TeacherSignal(name, model_output, field,
level, normalize=None)` specs for any other teacher output (`field` must start
with `teacher_`). It narrows the teacher's `active_outputs` to the requested
signals, builds and rolls back the teacher's own neighbor list (or, under
`neighbor_list="reuse"`, consumes the batch's list and refuses a missing key or
a mismatched cutoff stamp), and detaches every output — the scored batch comes back
exactly as it went in. `dtype` stores labels at a reduced dtype.

Signals differ in cost: the forward-pass ones share a single teacher pass,
`embeddings` adds a second (embeddings come from `compute_embeddings`, not from
the forward pass), and `hessian` adds an energy-only pass plus two backward
passes through it. `hessian` is the one signal that writes two fields, because
a Hessian-vector product is only comparable to a student's along the same
direction, so the probe travels with it. `probe_seed` names the stream that
direction is drawn from; leave it unset for training and offline labeling,
where coverage comes from redrawing, and set it — as the strategy does per
validation batch — for a number compared across passes.

---

## Offline Labeling

Labeling once beats labeling every epoch: a labeled store trains with **no
teacher forward pass at all**.

```python
scorer = InProcessTeacherScorer(teacher, ("energy", "forces"))
label_dataset(source_dataset, scorer, "data/labeled.zarr", batch_size=32)
```

`label_dataset` walks the dataset in contiguous chunks, attaches the teacher
fields, and writes the original fields plus the teacher fields to a Zarr store
read back through the ordinary `AtomicDataZarrReader` / `Dataset` path. It is
resumable (`resume=True`), drops the ephemeral neighbor tensors, rejects a
chunk whose schema drifts from the store's, and refuses a store an interrupted
run left inconsistent rather than resuming from a misaligned offset. Point
`validation_config` at a labeled store too.

Batches that arrive **unlabeled** are labeled on the fly by an internal
`BEFORE_FORWARD` hook, with autocast disabled so mixed-precision training
leaves the targets untouched and an on-the-fly label matches an offline one
exactly. Set `label_missing=False` to skip the teacher and let a missing target
surface from the loss instead.

---

## Losses

Any built-in term distills by pointing its `target_key` at a teacher field.
Signals with no supervised counterpart get their own term.

```python
loss_fn = ComposedLossFunction(
    [
        EnergyMSELoss(target_key="teacher_energy"),
        ForceMSELoss(target_key="teacher_forces", normalize_by_atom_count=True),
        AtomicEnergyMatchingLoss(),  # teacher_atomic_energies
    ],
    weights=[1.0, 10.0, 1.0],
    normalize_weights=False,
)
```

`AtomicEnergyMatchingLoss` matches the teacher's per-atom energy
decomposition — a target no reference dataset carries — against the student's
`predicted_atomic_energies` head.

`ComposedLossFunction` **renormalizes weights by default**, so composed weights
are ratios: `a + b + 0.2 * c` runs at `1/2.2`, `1/2.2`, `0.2/2.2`. Pass
`normalize_weights=False` for literal coefficients, which also stops a
`LossWeightSchedule` on one term from rescaling the others as it ramps.

---

## Representation, Curvature, And Boltzmann Objectives

Three further terms distill what no reference dataset has a column for. Each
asks more of the run than a target field, and each is checked at construction.

```python
from nvalchemi.training.distillation import (
    BoltzmannMatchingLoss,
    EmbeddingMatchingLoss,
    EmbeddingProjector,
    HessianMatchingLoss,
    embedding_distillation_fn,
    hessian_distillation_fn,
)
```

- **`EmbeddingMatchingLoss`** matches the teacher's per-atom representation.
  Both sides come from `compute_embeddings` rather than from a forward pass, so
  the run needs `training_fn=embedding_distillation_fn` and the student runs
  twice per batch. Widths differ across architectures: register an
  `EmbeddingProjector(student_width, teacher_width)` as a third model named
  `"projector"`, with an `optimizer_configs` entry of its own, and the training
  function routes the student's embeddings through it. The projection is
  applied to the student only — a learnable map on the target side would
  collapse the teacher's representation to something easy to hit. The projector
  is a training-time artifact; the distilled model is the student alone. Two
  embedding spaces agree only up to each architecture's own symmetry, so a
  residual floor is normal — weight the term as a regularizer.
- **`HessianMatchingLoss`** matches the curvature energies and forces do not
  pin down. Neither side forms a Hessian: both are products with one random
  probe, and the student's comes from `hessian_distillation_fn`, a second
  energy-only pass, so the student runs twice here too. The teacher's product
  and its probe arrive with the `hessian` signal. Its graph-balanced value runs
  one to two orders of magnitude above a force MSE on the same batch, so start
  the term a hundred to ten thousand times lighter than the force term, and
  read one batch's value as the one-sample estimate it is.
- **`BoltzmannMatchingLoss`** matches the Boltzmann distribution rather than
  the configuration — the relative entropy between the two distributions at a
  temperature, blind to a constant energy offset. It reads a batch as a sample
  of the *student's* own distribution, so the strategy requires `on_policy`,
  refuses a relaxation propagator and any convergence criterion, and warns when
  `replay_ratio` mixes in reference frames the student never visited. Seed it with
  replicas of one structure — energies of different systems are not comparable
  — set the term's temperature and the thermostat's from the same number, and
  hold `beta` at `0.5` or above: at `0` the objective is bounded by `log B` and
  its gradient vanishes once the softmax saturates, which reads as converged
  while the student is far off. The recommended shape is `replay_ratio=1` with
  a bounded `replay_capacity`.

---

## On-Policy Generation

`OnPolicyConfig` describes one generate-label-train segment. Setting
`on_policy=` on the strategy is what turns the pieces into a run; `run()` then
takes **no** dataloader.

```python
config = OnPolicyConfig(
    dynamics=NVTLangevin(student, dt=0.5, temperature=300.0, friction=0.01),
    teacher_scorer=InProcessTeacherScorer(teacher, ("energy", "forces")),
    initial_structures=InitialStructures(initial_dataset),
    generation_steps=50,        # propagator steps per segment
    label_frequency=10,      # label every Nth generated frame
    training_steps_per_segment=32,    # optimizer steps per segment
    batch_size=8,
    replay_ratio=0.25,       # share of each batch drawn from generated frames
    replay_capacity=8192,
)
strategy = DistillationStrategy(
    models={"student": student, "teacher": teacher},
    optimizer_configs={"student": [...]},
    loss_fn=...,
    num_steps=10_000,
    reference_dataset=reference_dataset,
    on_policy=config,
)
strategy.run()
```

Constraints worth knowing before you write the script:

- **The propagator must hold the very module registered as
  `models["student"]`** — on its own, or composed into a larger model. That
  object identity is what makes each segment generate from the weights the
  previous one trained, and it is checked at construction.
- **`reference_dataset` is the reference share of the mixture** and is
  required unless `replay_ratio == 1`, which is refused when one is supplied. It must be
  a teacher-labeled dataset in the replay-frame shape; one carrying reference
  `energy` or `forces` of its own is rejected rather than silently mixed in.
- **`initial_structures` is any `InitialStructuresSource`**, and
  `InitialStructures` is the reference one — one position over its rows, shared
  by the initial batch, any backfill, and a restart. A bare dataset is wrapped
  for you. Unbudgeted, it propagates every row it owns as one batch, so size the
  store to the device; budgeted (`max_atoms`, `max_batch_size`), it packs the
  batch first-fit and leaves the rest for the backfill. A source of your own
  implements `probe`, `initial_batch`, `shard`, `exhausted`, `draw`,
  `state_dict`, and `load_state_dict`; add `to_spec_dict`/`from_spec_dict` to
  make it a recipe reference.
- **One segment is one epoch.** `AFTER_EPOCH` and epoch-cadence validation land
  at segment boundaries; step-cadence validation fires inside them.
- **Multi-rank runs are data-parallel.** Add a `DDPHook` and launch one
  process per GPU. Each rank propagates its own strided shard of the initial
  structures — `DistillationStrategy.structure_shard` — labels it with its own
  teacher replica, and fills its own replay buffer; only student gradients
  cross the interconnect. Size the initial structures to a whole multiple of
  the world and sort them by atom count, since the deal strides by index and
  balances structure counts rather than work. The reference dataset is *not*
  sharded. A multi-rank launch that
  leaves the student unwrapped is refused.
- `OnPolicyConfig.seed` keys the mixture sampler; vary it, not the global torch
  seed, to make replicate runs draw independently.

Lower-level pieces, if you drive generation yourself: `TeacherLabelHook` is the
`AFTER_STEP` dynamics hook that attaches `teacher_*` fields to the live frame
and mirrors a stripped copy into a `DataSink` — `OnPolicyConfig.capture_sink`
picks that sink for the loop (a `GPUBuffer` stays on the device); `ReplayBuffer`
accumulates those frames behind a frozen key schema, with an `AdmissionPolicy`
deciding what enters (`OnPolicyConfig.replay_admission`) and an
`EvictionPolicy` what a full buffer drops (`FIFO` is `"fifo"`; a policy
instance goes on `replay_eviction`); `build_mixed_loader` draws each batch at an
exact reference/replay composition and **must be rebuilt after every segment**
because its batch sampler reads child dataset lengths once.

---

## Checkpoints And Restart

Checkpointing works as it does for any strategy, with two additions.

**The teacher is stored once per checkpoint root.** A frozen teacher whose
weights are written into every periodic checkpoint duplicates a model that
never changes. Ordinarily the first checkpoint under a root writes
`models/teacher/checkpoints/0.pt`; a root seeded by a plain training run, or
repaired after its weight file went missing, holds the copy at a later index.
Every other checkpoint writes no teacher weight file of its own. It records a
*model reference* instead: a `model_references`
manifest entry naming that index plus a cheap fingerprint. The checkpoint
interval therefore costs the student's weights alone, whatever the teacher's
size, so shorten it freely.

The fingerprint carries a tensor count, an element count, and a digest over
each state-dict entry's name, shape, dtype, and values. Values are read at
`float64` on the host, so the device does not change the digest. A tensor of
at most 4096 values (per-element tables, biases) is hashed whole. A larger one
contributes 64 values spanning its whole index range, first and last included.
Loading reads the stored weights back and verifies the fingerprint, so a
replaced or truncated copy raises `ValueError` instead of quietly training
against a different model. Precision is part of the identity: a `bfloat16` copy
is a different model to the fingerprint.

**One root holds one copy.** Saving a *different* copy of the teacher into a
root that already holds one raises `ValueError` at save time. The model
reference is root-global, and moving it would repoint every checkpoint already
written there. Give a second teacher its own checkpoint
root. Re-storing an *identical* copy is allowed, which is how a root whose
stored weight file went missing is repaired.

The teacher's `checkpoint_spec()` still rebuilds its architecture, but it is
never trusted for the weights. A teacher loaded from a fine-tune checkpoint
publishes the spec of what it was originally built from.

**An on-policy run resumes its trajectory.** A *restart bundle* travels through
the checkpoint: the live trajectory batch, the propagator's cumulative step
count, the initial structures' position, and the replay frames. A resumed run
therefore continues the same trajectory rather than seeding a fresh one. It
backfills from where the interrupted run left the source, rather than
re-serving structures it already relaxed. The built-in integrators draw their
Langevin noise from a counter-based generator keyed on the step count, so
their continuation is exact. The bundle also records the settings the run
used, so a resumed loop that sets one differently says so with a
`UserWarning`. A run whose generation ran dry checkpoints its frames and the
exhaustion, and resumes training on the buffer without regenerating.

Restart lands on a **segment boundary**. The interrupted segment is counted as
finished on the way in: its `AFTER_EPOCH` hooks do not fire, its leftover
training batches are not replayed, and the mixture sampler advances past its
epoch index. The run then opens a fresh segment, which begins by generating. A
checkpoint written part-way through a training phase therefore costs one extra
generation phase.

Two things to budget for. First, the bundle is **rank-local**: it rides in a
strategy checkpoint, which `CheckpointHook` writes on rank zero alone. It is
consumed only when a single rank wrote it and a single rank is restoring it.
Otherwise `OnPolicySettings.restart` decides:

- `"error"` (default) refuses to start, naming the reason and the remedy.
- `"reseed"` drops the bundle with a `UserWarning`, and each rank reseeds from
  its own share with a **cold replay buffer**. The first segments after such a
  restart draw from the reference dataset alone.
- `"resume"` also refuses a restore that carries no bundle.

Any multi-rank restart, matched world sizes included, therefore needs
`restart="reseed"`.

Second, a restore **replaces** the replay frames rather than merging them
(`buffer.clear()`, then refill). Merging would skew the weighting toward stale
pre-restart states, double the memory, and reach the eviction horizon a
restart early. It would not lose diversity, because the mixed loader draws
with replacement.

```python
strategy.restore_checkpoint(run_dir / "checkpoints")
strategy.run()
```

From the CLI the same restart is one command against the recipe the run started
from:

```bash
nvalchemi-training distill spec resume runs/onpolicy/checkpoints \
  --spec onpolicy.json
```

---

## Recipe Serialization

`to_spec_dict()` carries a whole on-policy run as references. Round-tripping
needs the models supplied, because a recipe names them by role:

```python
spec = strategy.to_spec_dict()
rebuilt = DistillationStrategy.from_spec_dict(
    spec, models={"student": student, "teacher": teacher}
)
```

What serializes:

- every scalar setting, verbatim
- the propagator, as `cls_path` plus kwargs, with the student rebound at build
  time
- the scorer, as its signal set (custom `TeacherSignal` specs as dicts),
  `dtype`, `probe_seed`, `neighbor_list`, `autocast` (a dtype by its `torch`
  name), and the model name `"teacher"`
- `initial_structures`, as its store plus the budgets and `recycle` it was
  built with, but never its position, which is restart state
- path-backed datasets, as the store they read, and a `MultiDataset` as the
  list of stores it concatenates

A *runtime-only field* holds a live object that no recipe can describe, so
the caller re-supplies it at construction. What stays **runtime-only**:

- `convergence_hook` (set `fmax` instead to keep the criterion in the recipe)
- `capture_sink`, `replay_admission`, and `divergence` (omitted with a
  warning; a rebuilt loop stages frames in host memory, admits every frame,
  and flags non-finite positions or forces)
- a policy instance on `replay_eviction` (recorded as `"fifo"`; a policy
  other than `FIFO` warns)
- a propagator's hooks, sinks, and convergence hook
- any dataset holding its samples in memory

A custom `InitialStructuresSource` travels under `source_cls` through its own
`to_spec_dict`/`from_spec_dict`, and a custom `TeacherScorer` travels under
`scorer_cls` the same way (the `SpecSerializable` protocol). One without those
methods is refused with the remedy. The omitted collaborators warn, naming
them. The check reads the *live* propagator, so a collaborator registered
after construction counts, and a propagator a recipe built is checked too. The
segment loop's own `TeacherLabelHook` is excluded. An in-memory dataset raises
with the fix in the message: write it with `label_dataset` and point the
recipe at the path. A piece the recipe cannot describe leaves the whole
`on_policy` entry out, rather than producing a recipe that rebuilds into a
different run.

A rebuilt propagator loses those collaborators. A missing neighbor-list hook is
loud: the model reads neighbor tensors off the batch and raises `KeyError`
without them. The silent losses are the convergence hook, the sinks, and any
thermostat or logging hook.

`from_spec_dict` takes `on_policy=` and `reference_dataset=` overrides for
exactly those cases. An explicitly supplied `on_policy` outranks the spec's own
`on_policy` block rather than being replaced by it.

---

## Evaluation And Acceptance

Import from the `evaluation` subpackage, not the distillation namespace — an
acceptance run pulls in the dynamics engine and the reporting stack that
training does not need.

```python
from nvalchemi.training.distillation.evaluation import (
    AcceptanceThresholds,
    StudentEvaluation,
    build_acceptance_report,
    evaluate_accuracy,
    measure_throughput,
    measured_bars,
    non_conservative_residual,
    StabilityMonitor,
)

accuracy = evaluate_accuracy(student, holdout_loader, targets="teacher",
                             scorer=teacher)
report = build_acceptance_report(
    [StudentEvaluation(name="small", accuracy=accuracy)],
    AcceptanceThresholds(max_forces_mae=0.05),
)
print(report.accepted)
```

- `evaluate_accuracy` runs through `ValidationLoop`, so eval mode, autograd
  policy, and device placement match training validation. **No autocast runs**:
  the loop is built standalone, with no strategy and no registered
  `MixedPrecisionHook` to take a context from, so the student predicts in its
  own dtype. Metrics are exact global residual sums, not the (graph-balanced)
  loss.
- `StabilityMonitor` is a dynamics hook reporting energy drift and momentum
  conservation over a trajectory the student drives. Give it `warmup_steps`
  long enough to cover relaxation, or a transient is reported as drift.
- `non_conservative_residual` bounds how well a conservative student can fit a
  direct-force teacher. It is scale-dependent — read its docstring before
  quoting the number.
- `measure_throughput`, `extensivity_error`, and the radial-distribution pair
  round out the report.
- `StabilityMonitor.metrics()` is a **method**, not an attribute, and needs at
  least two samples recorded at two different steps.
- **A bar with no measurement behind it fails the student**, rather than being
  skipped. Every metric rebuilds from its own `to_dict` export with
  `from_dict`, so a sweep can evaluate each student in its own job and assemble
  one report at the end.
- Never hard-code which bars you may state. `measured_bars(*families,
  accuracy_quantities=...)` answers it from the measurements in hand: naming a
  family is necessary, and for the accuracy bars the compared quantities narrow
  it further, since a pass scored on energy alone fills no force bar.
- That is why a **recipe** may only carry
  `measured_bars("accuracy", accuracy_quantities=evaluation.quantities)`:
  `distill evaluate` scores a holdout and fills nothing else, so any other bar
  in `evaluation.thresholds` is refused at parse time rather than failing the
  student on a number nobody took. Widen `evaluation.quantities` to earn a bar
  the pass skipped; measure drift, throughput, extensivity, RDF, and the
  from-scratch baseline in Python and build the report there.
- `distill evaluate --json-out` writes a non-finite metric as the string
  `"nan"`, `"inf"`, or `"-inf"`, so the export stays parseable by a strict JSON
  reader instead of carrying Python's bare `NaN` token; `from_dict` decodes
  the string back into the float on every metric field.
- `distill evaluate` scores the **averaged** weights when the recipe's
  `student.hooks` carry an `EMAHook` — the run's own validation reads them, so
  the gate does too — and prints `weights: ema (student.hooks EMAHook)` or
  `weights: raw` above the report. The same `"ema"`/`"raw"` marker is recorded
  as `StudentEvaluation.weights`, so a `--json-out` export says which weights
  it measured once a sweep assembles several of them into one report.

---

## CLI

Use the CLI when the user wants an on-the-rails run from a *recipe*: one JSON
file, validated by `DistillationJobSpec`, that describes the whole run. Use the
API when they need custom model construction, dynamic data routing, or
non-standard orchestration.

```bash
nvalchemi-training distill init \
  --tier small \
  --teacher-model mace --teacher-id small-0b \
  --dataset data/labeled.zarr \
  --holdout-dataset data/holdout.zarr \
  --output-dir runs/distill \
  --out recipe.json

nvalchemi-training distill spec report recipe.json
nvalchemi-training distill spec run recipe.json
nvalchemi-training distill evaluate recipe.json \
  --student-checkpoint runs/distill/checkpoints --json-out acceptance.json
```

`nvalchemi-training distill` is the one entry point. Commands: `init`,
`schema`, `spec report`, `spec run`, `spec resume`, `evaluate`.
`init --mode on-policy` adds the segment loop and **requires**
`--initial-structures`. `--dataset` is then the reference dataset the mixture
draws its reference share from. It cannot stand in for the initial
structures, because it carries no `forces` for the propagator's first step,
and a reference dataset that does carry `energy` or `forces` of its own is
rejected as a reference dataset by the strategy at construction.

`spec run` and `spec resume` take `--distributed/--no-distributed` (auto when
`WORLD_SIZE > 1`) and `--ddp-backend`. A multi-rank `spec resume` defaults
`--map-location` to this rank's device, so no rank stages its weights through
rank zero's. The restored strategy's `devices` then decide where the run
continues.

`init` also writes a `CheckpointHook` into `student.hooks` at
`<output-dir>/checkpoints`, saving every `num_steps // 10` steps (minimum 1).
`spec resume` then has a checkpoint to resume from, and
`evaluate --student-checkpoint` has one to score. The scaffolded hook sets
`save_at_end`, so it writes a terminal checkpoint at the next index whenever
the run finished on a step the interval missed. `evaluate` therefore scores
the weights the run ended with, and a later `resume` has nothing left to
repeat. A hand-written hook is run as declared.

`--tier` selects a *student tier*, a **size template only**, from the registry
`DEFAULT_STUDENT_TIERS` (`small`, `base`, `large` built in). Each tier is a
`StudentTier` naming a width, a depth, and a radial-basis count, which `init`
writes into `student.spec.kwargs` for whatever constructor
`--student-cls-path` names. A tier never selects an architecture or a model
family. `--tier-kwargs KEY=VALUE` (repeatable, JSON-typed values) overrides or
extends the template. `register_student_tier(name, **kwargs)` adds a tier and
refuses a taken name. `init --tier` validates against the registry when the
command runs.

`spec run` and `spec resume` take the training CLI's loader options
(`--batch-size`, `--shuffle/--no-shuffle`, `--drop-last`, `--prefetch-factor`,
`--num-streams`, `--pin-memory`, `--use-streams/--no-use-streams`) and
validation options (`--validation-dataset`, `--validation-every-epochs`,
`--validation-every-steps`), shared through `nvalchemi.training.cli_common`.
`evaluate` takes the four prefetch options (`--prefetch-factor`,
`--num-streams`, `--pin-memory`, `--use-streams`) for its holdout loader.
`spec resume --budget checkpoint|recipe` (default `checkpoint`) says whose
`num_steps`/`num_epochs` size the continued run. A recipe budget below what
the checkpoint completed, or in the other unit, is refused either way.
`evaluate --weights auto|ema|raw` (default `auto`) picks the EMA average when
the recipe declares an `EMAHook`, a subclass included, and the trained weights
otherwise. `ema` fails without an average, `raw` never reads one, and the
choice lands in the report's `weights`.

`evaluate` exits non-zero on a missed bar, so a sweep gates on the command
rather than on parsing its output. Its `--map-location` names the one device
the student, the teacher, the holdout, and the errors all run on, so a
GPU-trained student scores on a host with no GPU. On `spec resume`, the same
flag names the device the checkpoint is loaded onto and the continued run
takes.

## Caveats

- Give the teacher the outputs the signals need. Requesting `stress` from a
  teacher that does not declare it fails at construction, which is the point.
- Point `target_key` at `teacher_*`, never at the reference field. A term left
  on `energy` silently trains against dataset labels.
- Prefer `normalize_weights=False` when you mean literal loss coefficients.
- Precompute labels with `label_dataset` whenever the dataset is reused; it
  removes the teacher from the training loop entirely.
- On-policy runs need a reference dataset. A `replay_ratio` near `1.0` drifts off the
  reference distribution with nothing pulling it back.
- The checkpoint interval is not a teacher-size trade-off: the teacher is
  stored once per checkpoint root, so a short interval costs the student's
  weights alone. Loading verifies the stored copy against a sampled
  fingerprint.
- Distributed: both loops scale with `DDPHook`. Offline sharding is ordinary
  training; the on-policy loop additionally shards the initial structures per
  rank, keeps the replay buffer rank-local, and leaves the reference dataset
  replicated.
